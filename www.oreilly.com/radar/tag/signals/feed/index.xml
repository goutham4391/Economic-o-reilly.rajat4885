<p>It’s hardly news to talk about the AI developments of the last month. DALL-E is increasingly popular, and being used in production. Google has built a robot that incorporates a large language model so that it can respond to verbal requests. And we’ve seen a plausible argument that natural language models can be made to reflect human values, without raising the question of consciousness or sentience.</p>



<p>For the first time in a long time we’re talking about the Internet of Things. We’ve got a lot of robots, and Chicago is attempting to make a “smart city” that doesn’t facilitate surveillance. We’re also seeing a lot in biology. Can we make a real neural network from cultured neurons? The big question for biologists is how long it will take for any of their research to make it out of the lab.</p>



<h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>

<p>The large model train keeps rolling on. This month, we’ve seen the release of Bloom, an open, large language model developed by the BigScience collaboration, the first public access to DALL-E (along with a guide to prompt engineering), a Copilot-like model for generating regular expressions from English-language prompts, and Simon Willison’s experiments using GPT-3 to explain JavaScript code.</p>



<p>On other fronts, NIST has released the first proposed standard for post-quantum cryptography (i.e., cryptography that can’t be broken by quantum computers). CRISPR has been used in human trials to re-engineer a patient’s DNA to reduce cholesterol. And a surprising number of cities are paying high tech remote workers to move there.</p>

<p>This month, large models are even more in the news than last month: the open source Bloom model is almost finished, Google’s LaMDA is good enough that it can trick people into thinking it’s sentient, and DALL-E has gotten even better at drawing what you ask.</p>



<p>The most important issue facing technology might now be the protection of privacy. While that’s not a new concern, it’s a concern that most computer users have been willing to ignore, and that most technology companies have been willing to let them ignore. New state laws that criminalize having abortions out of state and the stockpiling of location information by antiabortion groups have made privacy an issue that can’t be ignored.</p>

<p>The explosion of large models continues.&nbsp;Several developments are especially noteworthy. DeepMind’s Gato model is unique in that it’s a single model that’s trained for over 600 different tasks; whether or not it’s a step towards general intelligence (the ensuing debate may be more important than the model itself), it’s an impressive achievement. Google Brain’s Imagen creates photorealistic images that are impressive, even after you’ve seen what DALL-E 2 can do. And Allen AI’s Macaw (surely an allusion to Emily Bender and Timnit Gebru’s <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922">Stochastic Parrots</a> paper) is open source, one tenth the size of GPT-3, and claims to be more accurate. Facebook/Meta is also releasing an open source large language model, including the model’s training log, which records in detail the work required to train it.</p>

<p>April was the month for large language models. There was one announcement after another; most new models were larger than the previous ones, several claimed to be significantly more energy efficient. The largest (as far as we know) is Google’s GLAM, with 1.2 trillion parameters–but requiring significantly less energy to train than GPT-3. Chinchilla has ¼ as many parameters as GPT-3, but claims to outperform it. It’s not clear where the race to bigger and bigger models will end, or where it will lead us. The PaLM model claims to be able to reason about cause and effect (in addition to being more efficient than other large models); we don’t yet have thinking machines (and we may never), but we’re getting closer. It’s also good to see that energy efficiency has become part of the conversation.</p>

<p>March was a busy month, especially for developers working with GPT-3. After surprising everybody with its ability to write code, it’s not surprising that GPT-3 is appearing in other phases of software development. One group has written a tool that creates regular expressions from verbal descriptions; another tool generates Kubernetes configurations from verbal descriptions. In his newsletter, Andrew Ng talks about the future of low-code AI: it’s not about eliminating coding, but eliminating the need to write all the boilerplate. The latest developments with large language models like GPT-3 suggest that the future isn’t that distant.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the US copyright office has determined that works created by machines are not copyrightable. If software is increasingly written by tools like Copilot, what will this say about software licensing and copyright?</p>



<h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>

One particular kind of network allows pattern matching based on partial patterns (for example, face recognition based on a partial face), something that is difficult or impossible with current techniques.</li><li>OpenAI has <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://openai.com/blog/webgpt/" target="_blank">extended GPT-3 to do research on the web</a> when it needs information that it doesn’t already have. </li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://datacentricai.org/" target="_blank">Data-centric</a> AI is gaining steam, in part because Andrew Ng has been pushing it consistently. Data-centric AI claims that the best way to improve the AI is to improve the data, rather than the algorithms. It includes ideas like machine-generated training data and automatic tagging. Christoper Ré, at one of the last Strata conferences, noted that data collection was the part of AI that was most resistant to improvement.</li><li>We’ve seen that GPT-3 can generate code from English language comments.

<p>February was a short month, but it wasn’t short in interesting technology. Don Norman has published some excerpts from his forthcoming book, <em>Design for a Better World</em>, which will almost certainly become another classic. DeepMind has released some information about AlphaCode, which solves problems from coding competitions well enough to put it in the mid range of competitors. And Holochain is a decentralized framework for building peer-to-peer microservices–no cloud provider needed. Is it another component of Web3 or something new and different?</p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting theme from the last month has been discussions of what can be done with NFTs and other Web3 technologies aside from selling links to bored apes. Chris Anderson points out that NFTs are a new kind of link that includes history, and that’s a fascinating idea. We’re also seeing a lot of debate around the metaverse; an increasing number of companies are lining up in opposition to Facebook/Meta’s vision.</p>



<h2>AI</h2>



<ul><li>The Algorithmic Justice League has proposed paying “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.ajl.org/bugs" target="_blank">bug bounties</a>” for algorithmic harms, similar to the way security researchers are paid bounties for finding vulnerabilities in software.</li><li>OpenAI has released a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://openai.com/blog/instruction-following/" target="_blank">new version of GPT-3</a> that is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/01/27/1044398/new-gpt3-openai-chatbot-language-model-ai-toxic-misinformation/" target="_blank">less toxic</a>–less prone to reproducing racist, sexual, or violent language, though it can still do so when asked. This is not the end of the story, but it’s a big step forward. The new model, InstructGPT, is also much smaller: 1.3 billion parameters, as opposed to 175 billion.</li><li>How do humans learn to work with AI systems?&nbsp; When should a human co-worker accept an AI’s predictions?

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It’s been a year since our&nbsp;<a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/where-programming-ops/9781098105396/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">last report</a>&nbsp;on the&nbsp;<a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">O’Reilly learning platform</a>. Last year we cautioned against a “horse race” view of technology. That caution is worth remembering: focus on the horse race and the flashy news and you’ll miss the real stories. While new technologies may appear on the scene suddenly, the long, slow process of making things that work rarely attracts as much attention. We start with an explosion of fantastic achievements that seem like science fiction—imagine,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">GPT-3 can write stories</a>!—but that burst of activity is followed by the process of putting that science fiction into production, of turning it into real products that work reliably, consistently, and fairly. AI is making that transition now; we can see it in our data. But what other transitions are in progress? What developments represent new ways of thinking, and what do those ways of thinking mean? What are the bigger changes shaping the future of software development and software architecture? This report is about those transitions.</p>



<p>Important signals often appear in technologies that have been fairly stable. For example, interest in security, after being steady for a few years, has suddenly jumped up, partly due to some spectacular ransomware attacks. What’s important for us isn’t the newsworthy attacks but the concomitant surge of interest in security practices—in protecting personal and corporate assets against criminal attackers. That surge is belated but healthy. Many businesses are moving IT operations to “the cloud,” a shift that’s probably been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. What does that mean for the way software is designed and built? Virtual and augmented reality are technologies that were languishing in the background; has talk of the “metaverse” (sparked in part by Mark Zuckerberg) given VR and AR new life? And it’s no surprise that there’s a lot of interest in blockchains and NFTs. What does that mean, and how is it affecting software developers?</p>



<p>To understand the data from our learning platform, we must start by thinking about bias. First, our data is biased by our customer base. Of course. There’s no sampling error; all of our customers “vote” with the content they use. You could read this as a report on the biases of our customer base. Our customer base is large and worldwide (millions of developers, from well over 100 countries), but we won’t pretend that it’s representative of all programmers and technologists. While our customers include many individual developers, contractors, and hobbyist programmers, commercial (enterprise) software developers are very heavily represented—although there are certainly areas into which we’d like more visibility, such as the crucial Asia-Pacific software development community.</p>



<p>We used data from the first nine months (January through September) of 2021. When doing year-over-year comparisons, we used the first nine months of 2020.<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></p>



<p>We looked at four specific kinds of data: search queries, questions asked to O’Reilly Answers (an AI engine that has indexed all of O’Reilly’s textual content; more recently, transcripts of video content and content from Pearson have been added to the index), resource usage by title, and resource usage by our topic taxonomy. There are some important biases here. If resources don’t exist, our customers can’t use them. To take one example, at this point, the platform has no content on the QUIC protocol or HTTP/3. Regardless of the level of interest, usage for these topics is going to be zero.</p>



<p>Search queries behave differently. Users certainly can search for content that doesn’t exist, so searches can be a good leading indicator of technology trends. However, most searches on our platform are single-word terms: users search for “Java” or “Python,” not “How do I use the Decorator pattern in C++?” (<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/article-answers.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">O’Reilly Answers</a>&nbsp;is a great resource for answering questions like this.) As a result, the signals we get from looking at searches aren’t very granular. Answers could provide additional granularity, since users ask full questions. But Answers is a new service, only released in October 2020. So while we can discuss whether Answers usage is in line with other services, it’s difficult to talk about trends with so little data, and it’s impossible to do a year-over-year comparison.</p>



<p>Content usage, whether by title or our taxonomy, is based on an internal “units viewed” metric that combines all our content forms: online training courses, books, videos, Superstream online conferences, and other new products. It includes content from all of the publishing partners in the platform, not just O’Reilly. Results in each group of topics are normalized to 1, so items within the same group can be compared (Java to Python but not Java to Ethereum, for example).</p>



<h2>O’Reilly Answers</h2>



<p>We’re very excited about O’Reilly Answers, the newest product on the platform. Answers is an intelligent search that takes users directly to relevant content, whether that&#8217;s a paragraph from a book, a snippet of a video, or a block of code that answers a question. Rather than searching for an appropriate book or video and skimming through it, you can ask a specific question like “How do you flatten a list of lists in Python?” (a question I’ve asked several times). Our approach to Answers was to do a simple “bag of words” analysis: count the number of times each word was used in all Answers queries. We divided Answers questions into two categories: “organic” queries, which users type themselves, and “question bank” queries, which are sample questions that users can click on. (Questions were rotated in and out of the question bank.) Our analysis only included organic questions; we didn’t count clicks on the question bank. What’s perhaps surprising is that many users typed questions from the question bank into the Answers search bar. These retyped questions were counted as organic queries.</p>



<p>That explains the most commonly asked question on Answers: “What is dynamic programming?” That question appeared frequently in the question bank. It was evidently intriguing enough that many users typed it in, verbatim, in addition to clicking on it; it was the second-most-common organically typed question, only slightly behind “How do I write good unit test cases?” (also very popular in the question bank).</p>



<p>Ignoring stop words (like “and”) and significant words that aren’t really meaningful to us (like “good”), the top five words were “data,” “Python,” “Git,” “test,” and “Java.” (And you can see most of the words from those top two questions in the top 15 or 20 words.)</p>



<p>What can we learn from this? Data continues to be one of the most important topics for our users. A quick look at bigram usage (word pairs) doesn’t really distinguish between “data science,” “data engineering,” “data analysis,” and other terms; the most common word pair with “data” is “data governance,” followed by “data science.” “Data analysis” and “data engineering” are far down in the list—possibly indicating that, while pundits are making much of the distinction, our platform users aren’t. And it certainly suggests that data governance (slightly ahead of&nbsp;&#8220;data science&#8221; itself)&nbsp;is a topic to watch.</p>



<p>Python and Java have long been the top two programming languages on our platform, and this year is no exception. We’ll see later that usage of Python and Java content is very slightly down and that usage of content about Rust and Go is growing rapidly (though it’s still relatively small). The word “programming” was also one of the most frequently used words, reflecting our core audience. And “Kubernetes” was in the top 1%, behind “Java” and “Python” but ahead of “Golang” (top 2%) and “Rust” (4%). The frequency of questions about Kubernetes reflects the importance of container orchestration to modern operations. “AWS,” “Azure,” and “cloud” were also among the most common words (all in the top 1%), again showing that our audience is highly interested in the major cloud platforms. Usage of the term “GCP” and the bigram “Google Cloud” trailed the others, though to some extent that’s because Google has never been clear about the name of its cloud platform. Both “GCP” and “Google Cloud” were in the top 3% of their respective lists.</p>



<p>Words about cryptocurrency (“Bitcoin,” “Ethereum,” “crypto,” “cryptocurrency,” “NFT”) are further down on the list, though still in the top 20%. That’s not surprising. Elsewhere, we’ll see that the use of content about these topics is rising sharply, but usage still isn’t large. We have no “previous year” data for Answers, so we can’t discuss trends, but the fact that these terms are appearing in significant numbers is certainly important.</p>



<p>That quick dip into the bag of words gives us some clues about what we’ll see when we look at the data in more detail. Now let’s start investigating content usage: what our customers actually read, watched, or participated in during the past year.</p>



<h2>Becoming Secure</h2>



<p>Security was frequently in the news in 2021, and for the worst possible reasons. A wave of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/defending-against-ransomware-is-all-about-the-basics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">ransomware attacks</a>&nbsp;crippled important infrastructure, hospitals, and many other businesses, both large and small. Supply chain attacks, in which an attacker places a payload in software that’s delivered to its victim through normal distribution channels, occurred in both open source and commercial software. In&nbsp;<a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/kaseya-ransomware-attack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">one notable case</a>, the victim was a well-known enterprise security company, whose infected software was distributed to thousands of clients.</p>



<p>We saw large increases for content about specific topics within security. Usage of content about ransomware has almost tripled (270% increase). Content about privacy is up 90%; threat modeling is up 58%; identity is up 50%; application security is up 45%; malware is up 34%; and zero trust is up 23%. Safety of the supply chain isn’t yet appearing as a security topic, but usage of content about supply chain management has seen a healthy 30% increase. The increase for content on identity is a particularly important sign. Identity management is central to zero trust security, in which components of a system are required to authenticate all attempts to access them. Understanding identity management is a big step toward putting zero trust security into practice.</p>



<p>Usage of general content also increased. Units viewed for items with the word “security” or “cybersecurity” in the title increased by 17% and 24%, respectively. Network security, also a general topic, increased 15%. While these increases are relatively modest compared to specific topics like ransomware and privacy, keep in mind that in absolute numbers, the usage of “security” titles led all other security topics by a large margin. And a 17% increase in an established topic is very healthy.</p>



<p>Another important sign is that usage of content about compliance and governance was significantly up (30% and 35%, respectively). This kind of content is frequently a hard sell to a technical audience, but that may be changing. While compliance and governance are frequently mentioned in the context of data and privacy, it’s important to realize that they’re central issues for managing security. What are an organization’s responsibilities if it suffers a breach or an attack? Has the organization managed its data responsibly? This increase points to a growing sense that the technology industry has gotten a regulatory free ride and that free ride is coming to an end. Whether it’s stockholders, users, or government agencies who demand accountability, enterprises will be held accountable. Our data shows that they’re getting the message.</p>

<p>According to a&nbsp;<a href="https://ischoolonline.berkeley.edu/blog/cybersecurity-salary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">study by UC Berkeley’s School of Information</a>, cybersecurity salaries have crept slightly ahead of programmer salaries in most states, suggesting increased demand for security professionals. And an increase in demand suggests the need for training materials to prepare people to supply that demand. We saw that play out on our platform. Looking for titles matching security certifications proved to be a poor metric (probably because long, unwieldy certification names do poorly in titles), but when we look at our content taxonomy rather than title searches, we see that SSCP (System Security Certified Practitioner) is up 54%, and CompTIA Security+ is up 27%.</p>



<h2>Software Development</h2>



<p>Software development is a mega category on the O’Reilly learning platform. It includes almost everything, from programming languages to cloud to architecture and more. While it’s customary to start with a rundown on the programming language horse race, we won’t do that. Whether Python leads Java or not just isn’t interesting (though we will have a few words to say about that later on).</p>



<p>The most interesting topic within software development hasn’t yet made it to our platform. Everyone is talking about developer experience (DX): what can be done to make life better for software developers. How can their jobs be made more enjoyable, helping them to become more effective? That’s an issue that will become increasingly important as organizations try to keep programmers from jumping ship to another company. While we don’t yet have any content on developer experience, we’d be surprised if there isn’t some next year. For one source of ideas about where developer experience is headed, look at our report&nbsp;<a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/low-code-and-the/9781098112592/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"><em>Low Code and the Democratization of Programming</em></a>. In it, we tried to take a longer view—examining not what trends will change programming next year but what we might see five or ten years from now.</p>



<p>Software architecture, Kubernetes, and microservices were the three topics with the greatest usage for 2021. Their year-over-year growth is also very healthy (19%, 15%, and 13%, respectively). It only looks small when compared with the growth of topics like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-does-an-api-gateway-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">API gateway</a>&nbsp;(218%). That kind of growth reflects the “law” we’ve observed throughout this report: it’s easy for a small topic to have large growth numbers but much more difficult for a topic that’s already dominant. API gateway content gets roughly 1/250 as many units viewed as content on architecture or Kubernetes does.</p>



<p>However, we want to be clear: while API gateway’s usage numbers are relatively small, 218% growth is a very strong signal. So is the growth in cloud native (54%), starting from significantly more units viewed in 2020 (roughly 1/8 of architecture or Kubernetes). Enterprises are investing heavily in Kubernetes and microservices; they’re building cloud native applications that are designed from the start to take advantage of cloud services. And API gateways are an important tool for routing requests between clients and services.</p>



<p>In this context, it’s no accident that content usage for containers shows significant growth (137%), while Docker shows less growth but higher usage. Containers are proving to be the best way to package applications and services so that they’re platform independent, modular, and easily manageable. We don’t want to understate the difficulty of moving to containers and using tools from the Kubernetes ecosystem to manage them, but remember that a few years ago, enterprise applications were monoliths running on a small number of servers and managed entirely by hand. Many businesses have now scaled an order of magnitude or so beyond that, with hundreds of services running on thousands of servers in the cloud, and you’ll never succeed at that scale if you’re starting and stopping servers and services by hand. We’re still exploring this transition, and it will continue to be a big story for the next few years.</p>



<p>When we’re talking about microservices running in the cloud, we’re talking about distributed systems. So it’s no surprise that usage of content about distributed systems rose 39% in the past year. The related topics complex systems and complexity also showed significant growth (157% and 8%). It’s also worth noting that design patterns, which fell out of favor for a few years, have come back: usage is very solid and year-over-year growth is 19%.</p>



<p>Quantum computing remains a topic of interest. Units viewed is still small, but year-over-year growth is 39%. That’s not bad for a technology that, honestly, hasn’t been invented yet. Although some primitive quantum computers are available now, computers that can do real work are still several years away. (<a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/ibm-quantum-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">IBM’s roadmap</a>&nbsp;has 1,000-physical-qubit computers coming in two years, though the best estimate is that we’ll need 1,000 physical qubits to create one&nbsp;<a href="https://singularityhub.com/2021/07/19/google-gets-one-step-closer-to-error-corrected-quantum-computing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">error-corrected qubit</a>.) But when those computers arrive, there will clearly be people ready to program them.</p>



<p>We’ve said almost nothing about architecture, except to notice heavy usage and solid growth. All this ferment—rebuilding legacy applications, moving to the cloud, microservices, orchestration—doesn’t happen without good, consistent software design. Success with microservices is impossible without giving serious thought to designing good APIs for your services to present to each other and, in turn, to the rest of the world. The problem with legacy applications is that they’re inflexible: they leave you stuck with the capabilities you had 20 years ago. If you replace your old legacy software with new legacy software that doesn’t have the ability to evolve as your needs and opportunities change, if you build something that’s just as inflexible as what it replaced, what have you accomplished? This is where software architecture comes into play: how do teams build systems that aren’t just adequate for today but that will be flexible enough to grow with the business? Solid year-over-year growth and heavy usage is exactly what we’d expect to see.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig02-1048x545.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14261" srcset="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig02-1048x545.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig02-300x156.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig02-768x400.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig02.png 1184w" sizes="(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px" /><figcaption><em>Units viewed and year-over-year growth for software development&nbsp;topics</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Finally, last year we observed that serverless appeared to be keeping pace with microservices. That’s no longer true. While microservices shows healthy growth, serverless is one of the few topics in this group to see a decline—and a large one at that (41%).</p>



<h2>Programming Languages</h2>



<p>We’ve said many times that we’re uninterested in the language horse race. Usage of well-established programming languages changes very slowly year to year. Occasionally a language breaks out of the pack, but that’s rare. We’d go so far as to say it’s less of a horse race than a turtle race—a turtle race in which a language that’s slowly gaining traction in the enterprise space can gradually come to dominate the cool language&nbsp;<em>du jour</em>.</p>



<p>So we’ll avoid the horse race entirely and focus on possible reasons for any changes. What are the important changes since last year?&nbsp;C++&nbsp;has grown significantly (13%) in the past year, with usage that is roughly twice C’s. (Usage of content about C is essentially flat, down 3%.) We know that C++ dominates game programming, but we suspect that it’s also coming to dominate embedded systems, which is really just a more formal way to say “internet of things.” We also suspect (but don’t know) that C++ is becoming more widely used to develop microservices. On the other hand, while C has traditionally been the language of tool developers (all of the Unix and Linux utilities are written in C), that role may have moved on to newer languages like Go and Rust.</p>



<p>Go and Rust continue to grow. Usage of content about Go is up 23% since last year, and Rust is up 31%. This growth continues a trend that we noticed last year, when Go was up 16% and Rust was up 94%. Is the decline in Rust’s rate of growth a concern? Don’t let the second derivative fool you. Last year Rust content was starting from near-zero and 90% growth was easy. This year it’s well-established (I don’t think we’ve ever seen a language establish itself quite so quickly), and we expect growth to continue. Both Rust and Go are here to stay. Rust reflects significantly new ways of thinking about memory management and concurrency. And in addition to providing a clean and relatively simple model for concurrency, Go represents a turn from languages that have become increasingly complex with every new release.</p>



<p>We see less of the “functional versus object oriented” wars than we have in the past, and that’s a good thing. Both topics are down (14% and 16%, respectively). Functional features have been integrated into Java, C#, and a number of other languages, so the only real question to debate is how much of a purist you want to be. But that’s a distraction—our customers want to get their work done.</p>



<p>Having said all that, what about the “old guard”? They’re nice and stable. Python, Java, and JavaScript are still the leaders, with Java up 4%, Python down 6%, and JavaScript down 3%. (“Python” and “Java” are both in the top five words used in O’Reilly Answers.) Although any change under 10% is small in the greater scheme of things, we’re surprised to see Python down. And, like last year, usage of Java content is only slightly behind that of Python if you add Spring usage to Java usage. (Spring is a large, all-encompassing group of frameworks in the Java ecosystem, but Spring titles usually don’t mention Java.) C#, a core language on Microsoft platforms, was also stable (down 1% year-over-year).</p>



<p>Scala and Kotlin, two other languages that belong to the Java ecosystem, are both down, 27% and 9%, respectively. Scala’s drop is particularly noteworthy. That may reflect the release of Scala 3.0 in May 2021, which would tend to make content based on Scala 2 obsolete.</p>



<p>Use of JavaScript content on our platform is surprisingly low—though use of content on TypeScript (a version of JavaScript with optional static typing) is up. Is TypeScript replacing JavaScript? We’ll see in a few years. Even with 19% growth, TypeScript has a ways to go before it catches up; TypeScript content usage is roughly a quarter of JavaScript’s. The relatively low usage of JavaScript on our platform may reflect our enterprise-centered audience, large numbers of whom work on backend and middleware services. Our data is similar to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">TIOBE&#8217;s</a>&nbsp;(in which the top languages are Python, C, and Java) and sharply different from&nbsp;<a href="https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2021/08/05/language-rankings-6-21/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">RedMonk&#8217;s</a>&nbsp;(in which JavaScript leads, followed by Python and Java).</p>



<p>In our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/2021-data-ai-salary-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"><em>2021 Data/AI Salary Survey</em></a>, we noted that most respondents used more than one programming language. That’s certainly true of our audience as a whole. We also discovered that Python programmers had midrange salaries, while the highest salaries went to respondents who used Go, Rust, and Scala. Our interpretation was that Python has become table stakes. If you work with data, you’re expected to know Python; the ability to work with one of these other languages gives you added value. While we don’t have salary data for platform users, we suspect the same is true. If you work on enterprise or backend software, Java is table stakes; if you do frontend development, JavaScript is table stakes. But whatever your specialty or your primary language, fluency with next-generation languages like Go and Rust gives you added value.</p>



<p>One final final note and then we’ll move on. When we looked at our analysis of O’Reilly Answers, we were puzzled by the top question: “What is dynamic programming?” It seemed strange to see that at the top of the list. Stranger still: while that question was in the question bank, when we removed question bank clicks from the data and looked only at organic questions (questions typed by a user), “What is dynamic programming?” was still at the top. We don’t think this is a rehash of the tired “static versus dynamic” debate of a few years ago; there were no questions about dynamic languages.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Dynamic programming</a>&nbsp;is a technique for breaking down complex problems into smaller components. It will clearly be a topic to watch as programmers continue to deal with increasingly complex systems.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig03-1048x674.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14262" srcset="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig03-1048x674.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig03-300x193.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig03-768x494.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig03.png 1162w" sizes="(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px" /><figcaption><em>Units viewed and year-over-year growth for programming languages</em></figcaption></figure>



<h2>Learning About the Cloud</h2>



<p>Our data about the cloud and cloud providers tells an interesting story. It’s clear that Amazon Web Services’ competition is on the rise. Usage of content about Microsoft Azure is up 32% and Google Cloud is up 54%, while the usage of AWS-related content has declined by 3%. Actual usage of content about Azure almost matches AWS, while Google Cloud is farther behind, although that may reflect the quantity of material available.</p>



<p>If we take a step back and look at the term “cloud” in general, we find that content about cloud is slightly larger than content about AWS and has grown 15% since last year. (Keep in mind that a title like&nbsp;<a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/machine-learning-in/9781119556718/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"><em>Machine Learning in the AWS Cloud</em></a>&nbsp;would match both terms.) Cloud native—the practice of building applications so that they run first in the cloud and take advantage of cloud services from the start—is up significantly (54%).</p>



<p>We also see another important trend. Usage of content about hybrid clouds and multiclouds is still small (roughly 1/10 of that of Google Cloud, the smallest of the major cloud providers), but growing very fast (145% and 240%, respectively). We won’t split hairs about the difference between a hybrid cloud and a multicloud; there’s enough confusion in the marketplace that, for all practical purposes, they’re identical. But we can say that multicloud and hybrid cloud approaches both reflect a fundamental reality: it’s difficult, if not impossible, to build a cloud strategy around a single provider. Cloud deployments aren’t top-down. They start with a research experiment here, a marketing project there, a group that’s frustrated with the time it takes to requisition hardware, and so on. Sooner or later, you have a cloud deployment—or, more likely, six or seven completely different deployments. By the time someone starts to build a high-level cloud strategy, the organization is already using two or three of the major cloud providers. They are already multicloud, whether or not they realize it. An important part of building a cloud strategy is recognizing that the “cloud” is inherently multi- (or hybrid) and that the biggest issue isn’t which provider to choose but how to build an effective cloud infrastructure across multiple providers. That’s an important aspect of becoming cloud native.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig04-1048x346.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14263" srcset="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig04-1048x346.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig04-300x99.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig04-768x253.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig04.png 1197w" sizes="(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px" /><figcaption><em>Units viewed and year-over-year growth for cloud topics</em></figcaption></figure>



<h2>Stable as the Web</h2>



<p>The core technologies for web programming have been very stable over the last two years. Usage of content about core components HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is almost unchanged (up 1%, up 2%, and down 3%, respectively). If Java and Python are table stakes for enterprise and data developers, so much more so are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend developers. They’re the foundational technologies for the web. If you’re not fluent with them, you’re not part of the conversation.</p>



<p>PHP is hardly a new technology—any PHP user will tell you that almost 80% of the web is&nbsp;<a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">built with it</a>. The use of content about PHP is up 6%, which doesn’t tell you how many jobs there are or will be but does mean that PHP isn’t leaving anytime soon. The use of content about jQuery (another older technology that’s often used in conjunction with PHP) is up 28%. And interest in web design, a perennial topic that will never go away, is up 23%.</p>



<p>Among the newer frameworks and meta frameworks, Svelte seems to be thriving (up 71%, though from a very low starting point), while interest in Vue and Next.js seems to be fading (down 13% and 13%). Svelte may become a challenger to the more widely used frameworks in a few years if this keeps up. There was surprisingly little interest in Jamstack. That may be because the term rarely appears in the title of books or training, though searches for the term “Jamstack” were also infrequent.</p>



<p>Usage of content about the React framework is also essentially unchanged this year (up 2%), while Angular framework content usage is down significantly (16%). It’s probably just coincidental that JavaScript and React usage are almost identical.</p>



<p>In the Pythonic corner of the web development space, Django is holding steady: the number of units viewed is healthy (and greater than Flask, Svelte, or Vue), and we saw no change year-over-year. Usage of content about Python’s Flask framework is headed downward (12% decline). Likewise, the most widely known Ruby framework, Rails, is down 19%.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig05-1048x578.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14264" srcset="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig05-1048x578.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig05-300x165.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig05-768x423.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig05.png 1179w" sizes="(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px" /><figcaption><em>Units viewed and year-over-year growth for web topics</em></figcaption></figure>



<h2>AI, ML, and Data</h2>



<p>There’s been a lot of speculation in the press about artificial intelligence. Are we heading into another “AI winter”? Is it an important technology for today, yesterday’s fad, or something impossibly far off in the future? To some extent, this kind of speculation comes with the territory, especially since Gartner published its famous “<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/gartner-hype-cycle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">hype curve</a>.” AI has certainly been hyped. But is it heading into the so-called “trough of disillusionment”?</p>



<p>We&#8217;d&nbsp;say no. That’s not what our data shows. Yes, usage of content with “artificial intelligence” in the title is down 23% in 2021, and “AI” is down 11%. But these topics are relatively small and narrow. The topic that clearly dominates this space is machine learning (ML): usage of AI plus artificial intelligence content is roughly 1/4 of ML plus machine learning.</p>



<p>What’s the difference between AI and ML? For the purposes of this report, we define machine learning as “the part of artificial intelligence that works”—and, implicitly, the part of AI that’s being put into practice now. AI is, by nature, a research topic. While we have plenty of researchers among our members, our core audience is programmers and engineers: people who are putting technology into practice. And that’s the clue we need to make sense of this puzzle.</p>



<p>Usage of content with “machine learning” in the title is flat year-over-year (down 1%, which is noise). Usage of content with “ML” in the title is up 35%. There are more titles with the phrase “machine learning”; if you add the two up, you get a very slight gain. Still noisy, but positive noise rather than negative. We don’t expect another AI winter—AI is too solidly entrenched in online business practices, and in ways that aren’t as visible as social media recommendations; you’ll never know (or care) whether the company that makes your espresso machine is using machine learning to optimize the manufacturing process and manage inventory, but if they aren’t now, they will be. However, it’s worth noting that AI and ML were the natural outgrowths of “big data” and “data science,” both terms that are now in decline. Big data, of course, never ended; it evolved: just look at the training data needed to build an AI model. The question for the coming year, then, is whether machine learning and artificial intelligence will “evolve”—and if so, into what?</p>



<p>Now let’s look at some specific techniques. Usage on deep learning is down 14%, but usage on neural networks is up 13%, reinforcement learning is up 37%, and adversarial networks is up 51%. Interest has clearly shifted from general topics to specific ones.</p>



<p>Natural language processing has been very much in the news. As was the case for machine learning, usage of content with “natural language processing” in the title hasn’t changed much (up 3%); the abbreviation “NLP” is up 7%. Again, we can look at some of the new techniques that have made the news. The platform had no content on Transformers, BERT, or GPT back in 2020. All three are now coming onto the map. Similarly, there’s currently no content on&nbsp;<a href="https://copilot.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">GitHub Copilot</a>, which uses the GPT-3 model to translate comments into working code, but we expect it to be a strong performer in 2022.</p>



<p>So what can we conclude? General topics like AI, ML, and GPT are holding their own with content usage or are down. However, usage of content about specific techniques like adversarial networks and reinforcement learning is growing. And content for the newest techniques, like BERT and Transformers, is only now starting to appear. That doesn’t look like a slide into disillusionment but like the natural consequence of a field that’s moving from theory into practice.</p>



<p>It’s also worth looking at the significant increase in the use of content about data governance (up 87%) and GDPR (up 61%). Everyone working with data should know that data governance and its related topics (data provenance, data integrity, auditing, explainability, and many other specialties) aren’t optional. Regulation of the use of data isn’t some vague thing off in the future. It’s here now: GDPR (the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation) is in effect, as is California’s Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Now is the time to start thinking about data governance—not later, when it will certainly be too late. Data governance is here to stay, and our platform shows that data professionals are learning about it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig06-1048x529.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14265" srcset="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig06-1048x529.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig06-300x151.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig06-768x388.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig06.png 1210w" sizes="(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px" /><figcaption><em>Units viewed and year-over-year growth for AI and ML&nbsp;topics</em></figcaption></figure>



<h2>Databases</h2>



<p>You can’t talk about machine learning without talking about data and databases. It’s no surprise that, when we look at content usage, Oracle is leading the pack. It’s also no surprise that Oracle’s growth is slow (5%); as we often observe, rapid growth is most often associated with smaller, newer topics. Usage of content about the open source MySQL database (now owned by Oracle) is roughly 1/4 as high and has grown substantially (22%).</p>



<p>It’s worth looking at alternatives to Oracle though. We’ve heard about the death of NoSQL, and certainly usage of content about NoSQL is down (17%). But that isn’t a good metric. NoSQL was never a single technology; databases like Cassandra, HBase, Redis, MongoDB, and many others are wildly different.&nbsp;<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/02/nosql-non-relational-database.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">NoSQL is really more a movement than a technology</a>—one that’s devoted to expanding the number of storage options for system designers. A good understanding of NoSQL means realizing that for most applications, relational databases are a good fit.</p>



<p>Of the more established NoSQL databases, MongoDB shows 10% growth. Cassandra, Redis, and HBase have declined sharply (27%, 8%, and 57%, respectively). Together, the four show total usage about 40% greater than MySQL, though the total for all four has declined somewhat (4%) since 2020. Momentum has clearly shifted from the NoSQL movement back to relational databases. But that isn’t the end of the story.</p>



<p>We’ve been following graph databases for some time, and in the last year, they’ve gotten a lot of press. But it’s difficult to discuss specific graph databases because most established database vendors have a graph database product integrated into their offering. That said, use of content with the term “graph databases” is up 44%. It’s still a small category, but that’s a significant signal.</p>



<p>Likewise, usage of content about time series databases (databases that associate every entry with a time stamp) is up 21%. Time series databases may prove important for applications stressing monitoring, logging, and observability. Using AI to analyze logs and detect malicious activity is one such application.</p>



<p>Relational databases still dominate the database world, and there’s no reason to expect that to change. Nor should it. The promise of NoSQL wasn’t replacing relational databases; it was increasing the number of options available. The rise of graph and time series databases are simply examples of this promise in action. It will be interesting to see whether this trend continues into 2022.</p>

<h2>Operations, DevOps, and SRE</h2>



<p>Operations is “up and to the right.” Very few topics in this group saw declines since last year, and a lot had big gains. As we said last year, it doesn’t really matter what you call operations: call it DevOps, call it SRE, call it George&#8230;this is the task of running the servers, managing software deployment, and keeping the business online. As many found out firsthand during the pandemic, keeping the servers running is crucial, not just to support staff working from home but also to move as much of the business as possible online. People have said “every business is an online business” for years now, but in the past year, that really became true. If your business wasn’t online when COVID-19 hit, it could have easily ceased to exist. Add to that the staffing pressures caused by illness and by resignations or job changes, and it quickly became clear that there’s a real need to do more with less. IT groups found themselves doing much, much more with fewer team members than before. The answer to these challenges is automation (to allow fewer people to manage more systems) and reliability engineering (reducing downtime to reduce staff stress).</p>



<p>We saw substantial increases in the use of titles with the words “observability” (up 124%), “container” (137%), “CI/CD” (109%), “monitoring” (up 36%), and “testing” (16%). A 36% increase for monitoring is very healthy, but the much larger increase for observability shows that this concept is winning people’s hearts and minds. In practice, many find the difference between observability and monitoring confusing. Observability ultimately boils down to the ability to find the information you need to analyze a system’s behavior, while monitoring refers to logging and watching certain preconfigured parameters that indicate the system’s health. It’s a subtle difference—one way to think of it is that monitoring tells you when something’s wrong, but observability gives you the data needed to debug unexpected or strange failure modes, predict failures more reliably, and understand system performance in depth.</p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">CI/CD</a>&nbsp;(continuous integration and continuous deployment) is the latest stage in a long trend of improved tools for automating the development and deployment process, starting way back in the 1970s with Unix’s make utility (for building software) and adding automated testing tools in the early 2000s (JUnit and its relatives) and automated deployment tools a few years later (Jenkins). We now build pipelines that automate the path from the programmer to the server. In the early days of the O’Reilly Velocity Conference, we heard about how companies could build, test, and deploy software many times per day. Automating the deployment process makes it much faster and more reliable, in turn making IT staff more effective because they no longer have to shepherd code “by hand” from the developer’s laptop to the production servers. CI/CD has now become standard practice for almost every online business. It’s something the enterprises that are just moving online, or just moving to the cloud, need to understand to get the most out of their staff.</p>



<p>“Testing” appears to be lagging other terms in this group, but it’s worth noting that the most frequently asked question on O’Reilly Answers was “How do I write good unit test cases?” The practice of automated testing, integrated into the deployment process, is one of the foundations of modern operations. If a software release doesn’t pass all of its tests, it can’t be deployed. That practice gives software developers the confidence to move fast without breaking things.</p>



<p>We’ve also seen increases in content about the tools used to deploy software. Git is up 44%, Kubernetes is up 15%, Docker is up 5%, and Terraform is up 6%. Kubernetes led all topics in this category in units viewed. Furthermore, the two most popular Kubernetes certifications, Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) and Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA), were up 24% and 13%, respectively. Docker’s relatively low growth may be attributed to the standardization of container formats (the Container Runtime Interface, or CRI), and the removal of Docker as a requirement for Kubernetes. There are now viable alternatives to Docker.</p>



<p>It’s worth looking a bit more at the Kubernetes ecosystem. While usage of content about Kubernetes is up 15% and Helm (Kubernetes’s package manager) is up 68%, usage of content about Istio (a service mesh, an important part of the Kubernetes ecosystem) is sharply down (46%). At first glance, this is confusing: why would Kubernetes and Helm be up, while Istio is down? It’s possible that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/opinion-editorial/googles-istio-move-ignites-open-source-tempest/2020/07/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">open source politics</a>&nbsp;around Google’s control over Istio hurt its adoption, though we suspect that only had a small effect. You’ve probably heard that Kubernetes has a steep learning curve; if you’re a developer, you may have experienced that yourself. Istio said, “Hold my beer, you haven’t seen complex yet.” A service mesh is an important part of container orchestration, but Istio is proving to be&nbsp;<em>too</em>&nbsp;complex. Kubernetes has proven essential for managing cloud deployments; Istio hasn’t.</p>



<p>Both Kubernetes and Istio originated at Google and were designed to solve Google-scale problems. But very few businesses—even those that any reasonable person would call “large”—need to manage IT infrastructure at Google’s scale. Will we eventually have container orchestration tools that solve problems for businesses that aren’t as huge as Google? Work on the Service Mesh Interface (<a href="https://smi-spec.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">SMI</a>), a standard interface between service mesh software and Kubernetes, may allow a new generation of service mesh implementations to arise; we hope some of those will be simpler.</p>



<p>Three tools are sharply down: Chef, Puppet, and Ansible (27%, 38%, and 20%). In last year’s report, we showed that the decline of these automated configuration management tools coincided with the rise of Docker and Kubernetes. That decline continues.</p>



<p>What about the top-level terms “operations,” “SRE,” and “DevOps” themselves? Usage of titles containing those words was up (7%, 17%, and 2%, respectively), though obviously these increases are smaller than we saw for tools or concepts. As with AI, we may be seeing this part of the industry mature: our customers are less interested in introductory content about the high-level concepts and more interested in specific ideas and tools that they can use in their businesses. It’s also worth highlighting the 2% increase for DevOps. Our 2020 report showed DevOps down 17% from 2019 to 2020. In 2021, that slide has stopped. Over time, we expect that terms like DevOps and SRE will come and go, but the concepts and the tools that they introduced will be with us long-term.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig08-1048x809.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14267" srcset="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig08-1048x809.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig08-300x231.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig08-768x592.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig08.png 1199w" sizes="(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px" /><figcaption><em>Units viewed and year-over-year growth for operations, DevOps, and SRE</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Finally, look at the units viewed for Linux: it’s second only to Kubernetes. While down very slightly in 2021, we don’t believe that’s significant. Linux has long been the most widely used server operating system, and it’s not ceding that top spot soon. If anything, its importance has increased: Linux is the standard operating system for the cloud. Even on Azure,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-developer-reveals-linux-is-now-more-used-on-azure-than-windows-server/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Linux dominates</a>. Solid knowledge of Linux is essential for anyone working in operations today.</p>



<h2>Cryptocurrency and Blockchain</h2>



<p>Now we’ll look at some ideas that have exploded in the last year. They aren’t necessarily new, but for various reasons they’ve taken off. Our data on these topics tends to be hazy. And, in Arlo Guthrie’s words, many of these topics have “come around on the guitar” one or more times in the past only to fade back into the noise.</p>



<p>Whether it’s the future of finance or history’s biggest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/bitcoin-a-gimmick-and-resembles-a-ponzi-scheme-black-swan-author-.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Ponzi scheme</a>, use of content about cryptocurrency is up 271%, with content about the cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum (ether) up 166% and 185% respectively. General content about blockchains is up 78%, and from a much higher starting point (reflecting the fact that our audience has more developers than speculators).&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Hyperledger</a>, a collection of blockchain technologies that targets enterprise markets, is up 66%. Our data doesn’t tell you whether to buy bitcoin or ether, but it does show a huge increase in interest.</p>



<p>We’ve seen a huge increase of interest in nonfungible tokens (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">NFTs</a>), but there’s where we run into data availability problems. Searches for the term “NFT” are up 4,474%, almost 45 times higher year-over-year. Granted, that’s from an extremely small starting point (only 26 searches in 2019). From that starting point, a 45x increase still takes NFTs to a relatively small endpoint. So which do you believe? A 45x increase or a small endpoint? Take your pick, but our data shows that NFTs shouldn’t be ignored.</p>



<p>Web3 is a collection of ideas about a “next generation” web that’s designed so that it can’t be dominated by a small number of gigantic platforms, like Facebook and Google. Web3 proponents typically mix decentralized protocols like the InterPlanetary File System (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">IPFS</a>) with blockchains and NFTs to make content immutable and ownable. As with NFTs, no content in our platform has “Web3” in the title. But we’ve seen a 343% increase in the number of searches for the term—again, from a small starting point. We’ve been watching decentralized web technologies for years (we staged a peer-to-peer conference in 2001) and wonder whether the connection between the decentralized web and blockchain will make it take off. Possibly&#8230;or possibly not. It isn’t clear what blockchains and NFTs bring to Web3 aside from the hype. We already have a web where anyone can publish. A web where everything has to be owned and where requiring all transactions to pay a tax to blockchain miners isn’t a step forward. We also see no guarantee that a decentralized web couldn’t be dominated by a small number of Google-sized players. We can’t tell you whether Web3 will succeed, but our data shows that it’s becoming an idea worth watching.</p>

<h2>Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and the Metaverse</h2>



<p>Virtual and augmented reality are also topics we’ve been tracking for years. They’ve often seemed at the point of breaking out, but they’ve never made it, at least in part because nobody wants to hang around wearing goggles all the time.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Google Glass</a>&nbsp;looked like it had a chance back in 2013, and it survives to this day in an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/glass/start/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">enterprise edition</a>, but it never achieved widespread use. Startups like Oculus (now part of Meta) have made VR goggles aimed at consumers, but they’ve never broken beyond a small segment of the gamer market.</p>



<p>What about this year? We still think VR and AR are on their way.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Mark Zuckerberg</a>&nbsp;kicked off a storm by talking about “the metaverse” back in July, and by more recently renaming Facebook “Meta.”&nbsp;<a href="https://news.microsoft.com/innovation-stories/mesh-for-microsoft-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Microsoft</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/real-world-metaverse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">many other companies</a>&nbsp;have followed suit by announcing their versions of the metaverse.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-glasses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Apple’s been quiet</a>, but the company is working on augmented reality glasses. (What little we’ve heard sounds like an update of Google Glass with current technology—but if any company’s core expertise is making something cool, it’s Apple.)</p>



<p>Has all this ferment shown up in our platform data? Keep in mind that we’re only using data through September (in both 2020 and 2021). The results are ambiguous. Use of titles containing the phrase “augmented reality” is down (22%), and those are the most heavily used titles in this group. But virtual reality, VR, and AR are all up (13%, 28%, and 116%, respectively), yielding a 24% gain across the entire group.</p>



<p>The term “metaverse” hasn’t shown up in any titles, though there’s a sharp increase in the number of searches for it (489%). And content about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">WebXR</a>, a vendor-neutral standard for rendering 3D content on VR- and AR-capable devices (in addition to pedestrian 2D devices), is now starting to show up. (VRML, an older standard, has vanished from view.) No content on WebXR was available in 2020, but some has appeared in 2021, and searches for “WebXR” have increased by 168%.</p>



<p>We’ll forgive you if you decide to bet against VR. Meta (née Facebook) has dragged its own name through the mud for way too long; while the company might succeed, it’s hard to imagine many people wanting to share video of the intimate details of their life with them. And while Zuckerberg is excited about the metaverse’s potential for “work from home” employees, it’s extremely difficult to imagine that a company will want a video feed of its staff’s activities going to the Meta mothership. But Apple has really become a master of conspicuous consumerism. It’s very hard to bet against them when it comes to making high-tech fashion accessories. Mark us cautiously&nbsp;skeptical.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig10-1048x226.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14269" srcset="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig10-1048x226.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig10-300x65.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig10-768x166.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/fig10.png 1195w" sizes="(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px" /><figcaption><em>Units viewed and year-over-year growth for VR and AR topics</em></figcaption></figure>



<h2>Until Next Year</h2>



<p>So after reviewing over a billion units viewed on over 50,000 items in the O’Reilly learning platform, after looking at a million unique search queries plus a smaller number of queries from Answers, where are we? What can we say about the coming year?</p>



<p>Many events grab attention: GPT-3 generating text that could have been written by humans. Cybercriminals demanding millions of dollars after a ransomware attack. Other newsworthy topics include new technologies like NFTs that are just starting to show up in our data and older technologies like virtual reality that may be on the brink of a surge. And there are even more technologies that get a lot of coverage in the technology press, though they aren’t yet appearing in our data in significant ways: robotic process automation (RPA), digital twins, edge computing, and 5G, to name a few. All of these technologies are important, or might be important, depending on where the future takes us. Some are genuinely exciting; others are rebrandings of older ideas.</p>



<p>The real work of technology isn’t coming up with splashy demos; it’s the hard work of taking these breakthroughs and integrating them into products. It’s coming up with solutions to real problems and deploying those as real-world services. It’s defending your IT infrastructure against attack in the middle of a pandemic. Using natural language models to build customer service systems that are less frustrating for the customer and the customer service agent; auditing loan approval systems to see whether they’re fair; preventing ransomware attacks rather than succumbing to them. It probably won’t make the news if there are 20% fewer successful ransomware attacks in the coming year. After all, few people notice when something&nbsp;<em>doesn’t</em>&nbsp;happen. But all of us will be safer nonetheless.</p>



<p>These are the changes that affect our lives, and these are the kinds of changes we see by looking at the data on our platform. Users learning more about security; customers learning more about architecting software for the cloud; programmers trying to come to terms with concurrency, and learning new languages and techniques to deal with complexity; and much more. We see artificial intelligence moving into the real world, with all the problems and opportunities that entails, and we see enterprises realizing that operations isn’t just a cost center—it’s the lifeblood of the business.</p>



<p>That’s the big picture, which (like a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Bruegel_the_Elder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Bruegel</a>&nbsp;painting) is built from many, many people, each doing what they think is important, each solving the problem that they face. Understanding technology—and understanding what the O’Reilly platform tells us—is not really about the flashy events, important though they may be; it’s all about understanding the people who depend on our platform every day and what they need to learn to get on with the task of building their futures.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Every year starts with a round of predictions for the new year, most of which end up being wrong. But why fight against tradition? Here are my predictions for 2022.</p>



<p>The safest predictions are all around AI.</p>



<ul><li>We’ll see more “AI as a service” (AIaaS) products. This trend started with the gigantic language model GPT-3. It’s so large that it really can’t be run without Azure-scale computing facilities, so Microsoft has made it available as a service, accessed via a web API. This may encourage the creation of more large-scale models; it might also drive a wedge between academic and industrial researchers. What does “reproducibility” mean if the model is so large that it’s impossible to reproduce experimental results?</li><li>Prompt engineering, a field dedicated to developing prompts for language generation systems, will become a new specialization. Prompt engineers answer questions like “What do you have to say to get a model like GPT-3 to produce the output you want?”</li><li>AI-assisted programming (for example, <a href="https://copilot.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">GitHub Copilot</a>) has a long way to go, but it will make quick progress and soon become just another tool in the programmer’s toolbox. And it will change the way programmers think too: they’ll need to focus less on learning programming languages and syntax and more on understanding precisely the problem they have to solve.</li><li>GPT-3 clearly is not the end of the line. There are already language models bigger than GPT-3 (one in Chinese), and we’ll certainly see large models in other areas. We will also see research on smaller models that offer better performance, like Google’s <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/language-modelling-at-scale">RETRO</a>.</li><li>Supply chains and business logistics will remain under stress. We’ll see new tools and platforms for dealing with supply chain and logistics issues, and they’ll likely make use of machine learning. We’ll also come to realize that, from the start, Amazon’s core competency has been logistics and supply chain management.</li><li>Just as we saw new professions and job classifications when the web appeared in the ’90s, we’ll see new professions and services appear as a result of AI—specifically, as a result of natural language processing. We don’t yet know what these new professions will look like or what new skills they’ll require. But they’ll almost certainly involve collaboration between humans and intelligent machines.</li><li>CIOs and CTOs will realize that any realistic cloud strategy is inherently a multi- or hybrid cloud strategy. Cloud adoption moves from the grassroots up, so by the time executives are discussing a “cloud strategy,” most organizations are already using two or more clouds. The important strategic question isn’t which cloud provider to pick; it’s how to use multiple providers effectively.</li><li>Biology is becoming like software. Inexpensive and fast genetic sequencing, together with computational techniques including AI, enabled Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, and others to develop effective mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 in astonishingly little time. In addition to creating vaccines that target new COVID variants, these technologies will enable developers to target diseases for which we don’t have vaccines, like AIDS. </li></ul>



<p>Now for some slightly less safe predictions, involving the future of social media and cybersecurity.</p>



<ul><li>Augmented and virtual reality aren’t new, but Mark Zuckerberg lit a fire under them by talking about the “metaverse,” changing Facebook’s name to Meta, and releasing a pair of smart glasses in collaboration with Ray-Ban. The key question is whether these companies can make AR glasses that work and don’t make you look like an alien. I don’t think they’ll succeed, but Apple is also working on VR/AR products. It’s much harder to bet against Apple’s ability to turn geeky technology into a fashion statement.</li><li>There’s also been talk from Meta, Microsoft, and others, about using virtual reality to help people who are working from home, which typically involves making meetings better. But they’re solving the wrong problem. Workers, whether at home or not, don’t want better meetings; they want fewer. If Microsoft can figure out how to use the metaverse to make meetings unnecessary, it’ll be onto something.</li><li>Will 2022 be the year that security finally gets the attention it deserves? Or will it be another year in which Russia uses the cybercrime industry to improve its foreign trade balance? Right now, things are looking better for the security industry: salaries are up, and employers are hiring. But time will tell.</li></ul>



<p>And I’ll end a very unsafe prediction.</p>



<ul><li>NFTs are currently all the rage, but they don’t fundamentally change anything. They really only provide a way for cryptocurrency millionaires to show off—conspicuous consumption at its most conspicuous. But they’re also programmable, and people haven’t yet taken advantage of this. Is it possible that there’s something fundamentally new on the horizon that can be built with NFTs? I haven’t seen it yet, but it could appear in 2022. And then we’ll all say, “Oh, that’s what NFTs were all about.”</li></ul>



<p>Or it might not. The discussion of <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/why-its-too-early-to-get-excited-about-web3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Web 2.0 versus Web3</a> misses a crucial point. Web 2.0 wasn’t about the creation of new applications; it was what was left after the dot-com bubble burst. All bubbles burst eventually. So what will be left after the cryptocurrency bubble bursts? Will there be new kinds of value, or just hot air? We don’t know, but we may find out in the coming year.</p>

<p>All things considered, December was a short month: I’m writing this on December 20, with a week and a half left until January. But it hasn’t been inactive. We’ve seen a lot of exciting developments, including the (beta) release of APIs to GPT-3; new language models from Google, one of which is significantly smaller and more efficient than most large language models; and new tools for documenting the biases of natural language datasets.</p>



<p>We’ve also had bad news on the security front. Log4J, a logging library that’s used in a lot of enterprise software, has multiple critical vulnerabilities that are being exploited. While the developers are working hard to find and release patches, these events underscore a big problem with open source software. The developers are a small group of dedicated, but underfunded, volunteers. What processes can be put in place to ensure that open source software is maintained? (Please don’t say DAOs. That just siphons funding away to others who don’t contribute to maintenance.)</p>

<p>The last month had a few surprises. Three items about quantum computing—all of which appeared on the same day. You’d think they were coordinating with each other. And of course, everybody wants to build their own version of the metaverse. There are several takes on having avatar-filled meetings in virtual spaces. Unfortunately, this solves the wrong problem. The problem that needs solving isn’t making meetings better, it’s making them unnecessary.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the past decade, the growth in low-code and no-code solutions—promising that anyone can create simple computer programs using templates—has become a multi-billion dollar industry that touches everything from data and business analytics to application building and automation. As more companies look to integrate low-code and no-code solutions into their digital transformation plan, the question emerges again and again: what will happen to programming?</p>



<p>Programmers know their jobs won’t disappear with a broadscale low-code takeover (even low-code is built on code), but undeniably their roles as programmers will shift as more companies adopt low-code solutions. This report is for programmers and software development teams looking to navigate that shift and understand how low-code and no-code solutions will shape their approach to code and coding. It will be fundamental for anyone working in software development—and, indeed, anyone working in any business that is poised to become a digital business—to understand what low-code means, how it will transform their roles, what kinds of issues it creates, why it won’t work for everything, and what new kinds of programmers and programming will emerge as a result.</p>



<h2>Everything Is Low-Code</h2>



<p>Low-code: what does it even mean? “Low-code” sounds simple: less is more, right? But we’re not talking about modern architecture; we’re talking about telling a computer how to achieve some result. In that context, low-code quickly becomes a complex topic.</p>



<p>One way of looking at low-code starts with the spreadsheet, which has a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/qG48P" target="_blank">pre-history</a>&nbsp;that goes back to the&nbsp;1960s—and,&nbsp;if we consider paper, even earlier. It’s a different, non-procedural, non-algorithmic approach to doing computation that has been wildly successful: is there anyone in finance who can’t use Excel? Excel has become table stakes. And spreadsheets have enabled a whole generation of businesspeople to use computers effectively—most of whom have never used any other programming language, and wouldn’t have wanted to learn a more “formal” programming language. So we could think about low-code as tools similar to Excel, tools that enable people to use computers effectively without learning a formal programming language.</p>



<p>Another way of looking at low-code is to take an even bigger step back, and look at the history of programming from the start. Python is low-code relative to C++; C and FORTRAN are low-code relative to assembler; assembler is low-code relative to machine language and toggling switches to insert binary instructions directly into the computer’s memory. In this sense, the history of programming is the history of low-code. It’s a history of democratization and reducing barriers to entry. (Although, in an ironic and unfortunate twist, many of the people who spent their careers plugging in patch cords, toggling in binary, and doing math on mechanical calculators&nbsp;<a href="https://oreil.ly/r6QOK">were</a>&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/jEImN" target="_blank">women</a>, who were later forced out of the industry as those jobs became “professional.” Democratization is relative.) It may be surprising to say that Python is a low-code language, but it takes less work to accomplish something in Python than in C; rather than building everything from scratch, you’re relying on millions of lines of code in the Python runtime environment and its libraries.</p>



<p>In taking this bigger-picture, language-based approach to understanding low-code, we also have to take into account what the low-code language is being used for. Languages like Java and C++ are intended for large projects involving collaboration between teams of programmers. These are projects that can take years to develop, and run to millions of lines of code. A language like bash or Perl is designed for short programs that connect other utilities; bash and Perl scripts typically have a single author, and are frequently only a few lines long. (Perl is legendary for inscrutable one-liners.) Python is in the middle. It’s not great for large programs (though it has certainly been used for them); its sweet spot is programs that are a few hundred lines long. That position between big code and minimal code probably has a lot to do with its success. A successor to Python might require less code (and be a “lower code” language, if that’s meaningful); it would almost certainly have to do something better. For example, R (a domain-specific language for stats) may be a better language for doing heavy duty statistics, and we’ve been told many times that it’s easier to learn if you think like a statistician. But that’s where the trade-off becomes apparent. Although R has a web framework that allows you to build data-driven dashboards, you wouldn’t use R to build an e-commerce or an automated customer service agent; those are tasks for which Python is well suited.</p>



<p>Is it completely out of bounds to say that Python is a low-code language? Perhaps; but it certainly requires much less coding than the languages of the 1960s and &#8217;70s. Like Excel, though not as successfully, Python has made it possible for people to work with computers who would never have learned C or C++. (The same claim could probably be made for BASIC, and certainly for Visual Basic.)</p>



<p>But this makes it possible for us to talk about an even more outlandish meaning of low-code. Configuration files for large computational systems, such as Kubernetes, can be extremely complex. But configuring a tool is almost always simpler than writing the tool yourself. Kelsey Hightower&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/vesCZ" target="_blank">said</a>&nbsp;that Kubernetes is the “sum of all the bash scripts and best practices that most system administrators would cobble together over time”; it’s just that many years of experience have taught us the limitations of endless scripting. Replacing a huge and tangled web of scripts with a few configuration files certainly sounds like low-code. (You could object that Kubernetes’ configuration language isn’t Turing complete, so it’s not a programming language. Be that way.) It enables operations staff who couldn’t write Kubernetes from scratch, regardless of the language, to create configurations that manage very complicated distributed systems in production. What’s the ratio—a few hundred lines of Kubernetes configuration, compared to a million lines of Go, the language Kubernetes was written in? Is that low-code? Configuration languages are rarely simple, but they’re always simpler than writing the program you’re configuring.</p>



<p>As examples go, Kubernetes isn’t all that unusual. It’s an example of a “domain-specific language” (DSL) constructed to solve a specific kind of problem. DSLs enable someone to get a task done without having to describe the whole process from scratch, in immense detail. If you look around, there’s no shortage of domain-specific languages.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a>&nbsp;was originally described as a DSL. COBOL was a DSL before anyone really knew what a DSL was. And so are many mainstays of Unix history:&nbsp;<em>awk</em>,&nbsp;<em>sed</em>, and even the Unix shell (which is much simpler than using old&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/crAGp" target="_blank">IBM JCL</a>s to run a program). They all make certain programming tasks simpler by relying on a lot of code that’s hidden in libraries, runtime environments, and even other programming languages. And they all sacrifice generality for ease of use in solving a specific kind of problem.</p>



<p>So, now that we’ve broadened the meaning of low-code to include just about everything, do we give up? For the purposes of this report, we’re probably best off looking at the narrowest and most likely implementation of low-code technology and limiting ourselves to the first, Excel-like meaning of “low-code”—but remembering that the history of programming is the history of enabling people to do more with less, enabling people to work with computers without requiring as much formal education, adding layer upon layer of abstraction so that humans don’t need to understand the 0s and the 1s. So Python is low-code. Kubernetes is low-code. And their successors will inevitably be even lower-code; a lower-code version of Kubernetes might well be built&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/UnbbF" target="_blank">on top of the Kubernetes API</a>. Mirantis has taken a step in that direction by building an&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Kubernete (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/W4CVm" target="_blank">Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Kubernete</a><a href="https://oreil.ly/W4CVm">s</a>. Can we imagine a spreadsheet-like (or even graphical) interface to Kubernetes configuration? We certainly can, and we’re fine with putting Python to the side. We’re also fine with putting Kubernetes aside, as long as we remember that DSLs are an important part of the low-code picture: in&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Paul Ford’s (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/haiKH" target="_blank">Paul Ford’s</a><a href="https://oreil.ly/haiKH"> words</a>, tools to help users do whatever “makes the computer go.”</p>



<h3>Excel (And Why It Works)</h3>



<p>Excel deservedly comes up in any discussion of low-code programming. So it’s worth looking at what it does (and let’s willfully ignore Excel’s immediate ancestors,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/bchdN" target="_blank">VisiCalc</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/kWIhe" target="_blank">Lotus</a>). Why has Excel succeeded?</p>



<p>One important difference between spreadsheets and traditional programming languages is so obvious that it’s easily overlooked. Spreadsheets are “written” on a two-dimensional grid (Figure 1). Every other programming language in common use is a list of&nbsp;statements: a list of instructions that are executed more or less&nbsp;sequentially.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/lcdp_0101-1048x348.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14095" srcset="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/lcdp_0101-1048x348.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/lcdp_0101-300x100.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/lcdp_0101-768x255.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/lcdp_0101.png 1376w" sizes="(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px" /><figcaption><em>Figure 1. A Microsoft Excel grid (source: </em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://oreil.ly/30QKZ" target="_blank">Python for Excel</a><em>)</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>What’s a 2D grid useful for? Formatting, for one thing. It’s great for making tables. Many Excel files do that—and no more. There are no formulas, no equations, just text (including numbers) arranged into a grid and aligned properly. By itself, that is tremendously enabling.</p>



<p>Add the simplest of equations, and built-in understanding of numeric datatypes (including the all-important financial datatypes), and you have a powerful tool for building very simple applications: for example, a spreadsheet that sums a bunch of items and computes sales tax to do simple invoices. A spreadsheet that computes loan payments. A spreadsheet that estimates the profit or loss (P&amp;L) on a project.</p>



<p>All of these could be written in Python, and we could argue that most of them could be written in Python with less code. However, in the real world, that’s not how they’re written. Formatting is a huge value, in and of itself. (Have you ever tried to make output columns line up in a “real” programming language? In most programming languages, numbers and texts are formatted using an arcane and non-intuitive syntax. It’s not pretty.) The ability to think without loops and a minimal amount of programming logic (Excel has a primitive IF statement) is important. Being able to structure the problem in two or three dimensions (you get a third dimension if you use multiple sheets) is useful, but most often, all you need to do is SUM a column.</p>



<p>If you do need a complete programming language, there’s always been Visual Basic—not part of Excel strictly speaking, but that&nbsp;distinction&nbsp;really isn’t meaningful. With the recent addition of&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/lF30q" target="_blank">LAMBDA</a>&nbsp;functions, Excel is now a complete programming language in its own right. And Microsoft recently released&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/in8eA" target="_blank">Power Fx</a>&nbsp;as an Excel-based low-code programming language; essentially, it’s Excel equations with something that looks like a web application replacing the 2D spreadsheet.</p>



<p>Making Excel a 2D language accomplished two things: it gave users the ability to format simple tables, which they really cared about; and it enabled them to think in columns and rows. That’s not sophisticated, but it’s very, very useful. Excel gave a new group of people the ability to use computers effectively. It’s been too long since we’ve used the phrase “become creative,” but that’s exactly what Excel did: it helped more people to become creative. It created a new generation of “citizen programmers” who never saw themselves as programmers—just more effective users.</p>



<p>That’s what we should expect of a low-code language. It isn’t about the amount of code. It’s about extending the ability to create to more people by changing paradigms (1D to 2D), eliminating hard parts (like formatting), and limiting what can be done to what most users need to do. This is democratizing.</p>



<h3>UML</h3>



<p>UML (Unified Modeling Language) was a visual language for describing the design of object oriented systems. UML was often misused by programmers who thought that UML diagrams somehow validated a design, but it gave us something that we didn’t have, and arguably needed: a common language for scribbling software architectures on blackboards and whiteboards. The architects who design buildings have a very detailed visual language for blueprints: one kind of line means a concrete wall, another wood, another wallboard, and so on. Programmers wanted to design software with a visual vocabulary that was equally rich.</p>



<p>It’s not surprising that vendors built products to compile UML diagrams into scaffolds of code in various programming languages. Some went further to add an “action language” that turned UML into a complete programming language in its own right. As a visual language, UML required different kinds of tools: diagram editors, rather than text editors like Emacs or vi (or Visual Studio). In modern software development processes, you’d also need the ability to check the UML diagrams themselves (not the generated code) into some kind of source management system; i.e., the important artifact is the diagram, not something generated from the diagram. But UML proved to be too complex and heavyweight. It tried to be everything to everybody: both a standard notation for high-level design and visual tool for building software. It’s still used, though it has fallen out of favor.</p>



<p>Did UML give anyone a new way of thinking about programming? We’re not convinced that it did, since programmers were already good at making diagrams on whiteboards. UML was of, by, and for engineers, from the start. It didn’t have any role in democratization. It reflected a desire to standardize notations for high-level design, rather than rethink it. Excel and other spreadsheets enabled more people to be creative with computers; UML didn’t.</p>



<h3>LabVIEW</h3>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/Dka0f" target="_blank">LabVIEW</a>&nbsp;is a commercial system that’s widely used in industry—primarily in research &amp; development—for data collection and automation. The high-school&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.firstinspires.org/" target="_blank">FIRST Robotics</a>&nbsp;program depends heavily on it. The visual language that LabVIEW is built on is called G, and doesn’t have a textual representation. The dominant metaphor for G is a control panel or dashboard (or possibly an entire laboratory). Inputs are called “controls”; outputs are called “indicators.” Functions are “virtual instruments,” and are connected to each other by “wires.” G is a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/tivSy" target="_blank">dataflow</a>&nbsp;language, which means that functions run as soon as all their inputs are available; it is inherently&nbsp;parallel.</p>



<p>It’s easy to see how a non-programmer could create software with LabVIEW doing nothing more than connecting together virtual instruments, all of which come from a library. In that sense, it’s democratizing: it lets non-programmers create software visually, thinking only about where the data comes from and where it needs to go. And it lets hardware developers build abstraction layers on top of FPGAs and other low-level hardware that would otherwise have to be programmed in languages like&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/ZwKeB" target="_blank">Verilog</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/HpVpY" target="_blank">VHDL</a>. At the same time, it is easy to underestimate the technical sophistication required to get a complex system working with LabVIEW. It is visual, but it isn’t necessarily simple. Just as in Fortran or Python, it’s possible to build complex libraries of functions (“virtual instruments”) to encapsulate standard tasks. And the fact that LabVIEW is visual doesn’t eliminate the need to understand, in depth, the task you’re trying to automate, and the hardware on which you’re automating it.</p>



<p>As a purely visual language, LabVIEW doesn’t play well with modern tools for source control, automated testing, and deployment. Still, it’s an important (and commercially successful) step away from the traditional programming paradigm. You won’t see lines of code anywhere, just wiring diagrams (Figure 2). Like Excel, LabVIEW provides a different way of thinking about programming. It’s still code, but it’s a different kind of code, code that looks more like circuit diagrams than punch cards.</p>

<h3>Copilot</h3>



<p>There has been a lot of research on using AI to generate code from human descriptions. GPT-3 has made that work more widely visible, but it’s been around for a while, and it’s ongoing. We’ve written about using&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/rt64V" target="_blank">AI as a partner in pair programming</a>. While we were writing this report, Microsoft, OpenAI, and GitHub announced the first fruit of this research:&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://copilot.github.com/" target="_blank">Copilot</a>, an AI tool that was trained on all the public code in GitHub’s codebase. Copilot makes suggestions while you write code, generating function bodies based on descriptive comments (Figure 3). Copilot turns programming on its head: rather than writing the code first, and adding comments as an afterthought, start by thinking carefully about the problem you want to solve and describing what the components need to do. (This inversion has some&nbsp;similarities&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/6GbYb" target="_blank">test-driven</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/22d9U" target="_blank">behavior-driven&nbsp;development</a>.)</p>



<p>Still, this approach begs the question: how much work is required to find a description that generates the right code? Could technology like this be used to build a real-world project, and if so, would that help to democratize programming? It’s a fair question. Programming languages are precise and unambiguous, while human&nbsp;languages&nbsp;are by nature imprecise and ambiguous. Will compiling human language into code require a significant body of rules to make it, essentially, a programming language in its own right? Possibly. But on the other hand, Copilot takes on the burden of remembering syntax details, getting function names right, and many other tasks that are fundamentally just memory exercises.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/lcdp_0103-1048x523.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14097" srcset="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/lcdp_0103-1048x523.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/lcdp_0103-300x150.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/lcdp_0103-768x383.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/lcdp_0103.png 1439w" sizes="(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px" /><figcaption><em>Figure 3.&nbsp;GitHub’s Copilot in action (source:&nbsp;</em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://copilot.github.com/" target="_blank">Copilot</a><em>)</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Salvatore Sanfilippo (@antirez) touched on this in&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/RrjpQ" target="_blank">a Twitter thread</a>, saying “Every task Copilot can do for you is a task that should NOT be part of modern programming.” Copilot doesn’t just free you from remembering syntax details, what functions are stashed in a library you rarely use, or how to implement some algorithm that you barely remember. It eliminates the boring drudgery of much of programming—and, let’s admit it, there’s a lot of that. It frees you to be more creative, letting you think more carefully about that task you’re doing, and how best to perform it. That’s liberating—and it extends programming to those who aren’t good at rote memory, but who are experts (“subject matter experts”) in solving particular problems.</p>



<p>Copilot is in its very early days; it’s called a “Technical Preview,” not even a beta. It’s certainly not problem-free. The code it generates is often incorrect (though you can ask it to create any number of alternatives, and one is likely to be correct). But it will almost certainly get better, and it will probably get better fast. When the code works, it’s often low-quality; as Jeremy Howard&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/h6CAz" target="_blank">writes</a>, language models reflect an average of how people use language, not great literature. Copilot is the same. But more importantly, as Howard says, most of a programmer’s work isn’t writing new code: it’s designing,&nbsp;debugging, and maintaining code. To use Copilot well, programmers will have to realize the trade-off: most of the work of programming won’t go away. You will need to understand, at a higher level, what you’re trying to do. For Sanfilippo, and for most good or great programmers, the interesting, challenging part of programming comes in that higher-level work, not in slinging curly braces.</p>



<p>By reducing the labor of writing code, allowing people to focus their effort on higher-level thought about what they want to do rather than on syntactic correctness, Copilot will certainly make creative computing possible for more people. And that’s democratization.</p>



<h3>Glitch</h3>



<p>Glitch, which has become a compelling platform for developing web applications, is another alternative. Glitch claims to return to the copy/paste model from the early days of web development, when you could “view source” for any web page, copy it, and make any changes you want. That model doesn’t eliminate code, but offers a different approach to understanding coding. It reduces the amount of code you write; this in itself is democratizing because it enables more people to accomplish things more quickly. Learning to program isn’t fun if you have to work for six months before you can build something you actually want. It gets you interacting with code that’s already written and working from the start (Figure 4); you don’t have to stare at a blank screen and invent all the technology you need for the features you want. And it’s completely portable: Glitch code is just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript stored in a GitHub archive. You can take that code, modify it, and deploy it anywhere; you’re not stuck with Glitch’s proprietary app. Anil Dash, Glitch’s CEO, calls this&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/kthcZ" target="_blank">“Yes code”</a>, affirming the importance of code. Great artists steal from each other, and so do the great coders; Glitch is a platform that facilitates stealing, in all the best ways.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/lcdp_0104-1048x637.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14098" srcset="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/lcdp_0104-1048x637.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/lcdp_0104-300x182.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/lcdp_0104-768x467.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/lcdp_0104-1536x934.png 1536w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/lcdp_0104.png 1990w" sizes="(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px" /><figcaption><em>Figure 4.&nbsp;Glitch’s prepopulated, comment-heavy React web application, which guides the user to using its code (source: Glitch)</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3>Forms and Templates</h3>



<p>Finally, many low-code platforms make heavy use of forms. This is particularly common among business intelligence (BI) platforms. You could certainly argue that filling in a form isn’t low-code at all, it’s just using a canned app; but think about what’s happening. The fields in the form are typically a template for filling in a complex SQL statement. A relational database executes that statement, and the results are formatted and displayed for the users. This is certainly democratizing: SQL expertise isn’t expected of most managers—or, for that matter, of most programmers. BI applications unquestionably allow people to do what they couldn’t do otherwise. (Anyone at O’Reilly can look up detailed sales data in O’Reilly’s BI system, even those of us who have never learned SQL or written programs in any language.) Painlessly formatting the results,&nbsp;including&nbsp;visualizations, is one of the qualities that made Excel&nbsp;revolutionary.</p>



<p>Similarly, low-code platforms for building mobile and web apps—such as Salesforce, Webflow, Honeycode, and Airtable—provide non-programmers with drag-and-drop solutions for creating everything from consumer-facing apps to internal workflows via&nbsp;templated&nbsp;approaches and purport to be customizable, but are ultimately finite based on the offerings and capabilities of each particular&nbsp;platform.</p>



<p>But do these templating approaches really allow a user to become creative? That may be the more important question. Templates arguably don’t. They allow the user to create one of a number (possibly a large number) of previously defined reports. But they rarely allow a user to create a new report without significant programming skills. In practice, regardless of how simple it may be to create a report, most users don’t go out of their way to create new reports. The problem isn’t that templating approaches are “ultimately finite”—that trade-off of limitations against ease comes with almost any low-code approach, and some template builders are extremely flexible. It’s that, unlike Excel, and unlike LabVIEW, and unlike Glitch, these tools don’t really offer new ways to think about problems.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting—in fact, it’s absolutely essential to note—that these low-code approaches rely on huge amounts of traditional code. Even LabVIEW—it may be completely visual, but LabVIEW and G were implemented in a traditional programming language. What they’re really doing is allowing people with minimal coding skills to make connections between libraries. They enable people to work by connecting things together, rather than building the things that are being connected. That will turn out to be very important, as we’ll start to examine next.</p>



<h2>Rethinking the Programmer</h2>



<p>Programmers have cast themselves as gurus and rockstars, or as artisans, and to a large extent resisted democratization. In the web space, that has been very explicit: people who use HTML and CSS, but not sophisticated JavaScript, are “not real programmers.” It’s almost as if the evolution of the web from a Glitch-like world of copy and paste towards complex web apps took place with the intention of forcing out the great unwashed, and creating an underclass of coding-disabled.</p>



<p>Low-code and no-code are about democratization, about extending the ability to be creative with computers and creating new citizen programmers. We’ve seen that it works in two ways: on the low end (as with Excel), it allows people with no formal programming background to perform computational tasks. Perhaps more significantly, Excel (and similar tools) allow a user to gradually work up the ladder to more complex tasks: from simple formatting to spreadsheets that do computation, to full-fledged programming.</p>



<p>Can we go further? Can we enable subject matter experts to build sophisticated applications without needing to communicate their understanding to a group of coders? At the Strata Data Conference in 2019, Jeremy Howard discussed an AI application for&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/XlERc" target="_blank">classifying burns</a>. This deep-learning application was trained by a dermatologist—a subject matter expert—who had no knowledge of programming. All the major cloud providers have services for automating machine learning, and there’s an ever-increasing number of&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/2BWTi" target="_blank">AutoML</a>&nbsp;tools that aren’t tied to a specific provider. Eliminating the knowledge transfer between the SME and the programmer by letting SMEs build the application themselves is the shortest route to building better&nbsp;software.</p>



<p>On the high end, the intersection between AI and programming promises to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/aXYJI" target="_blank">make skilled programmers more productive</a>&nbsp;by making suggestions, detecting bugs and vulnerabilities, and writing some of the boilerplate code itself.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/ykmOt" target="_blank">IBM</a>&nbsp;is trying to use AI to automate translations between different programming languages; we’ve already mentioned&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/wKLJs" target="_blank">Microsoft’s work</a>&nbsp;on generating code from human-language descriptions of programming tasks, culminating with their Copilot project. This technology is still in the very early days, but it has the potential to change the nature of programming radically.</p>



<p>These changes suggest that there’s another way of thinking about programmers. Let’s borrow the distinction between “blue-” and “white”-collar workers. Blue-collar programmers connect things; white-collar programmers build the things to be connected. This is similar to the distinction between the person who installs or connects household appliances and the person who designs them. You wouldn’t want your plumber designing your toilet; but likewise, you wouldn’t want a toilet designer (who wears a black turtleneck and works in a fancy office building) to install the toilet they designed.</p>



<p>This model is hardly a threat to the industry as it’s currently institutionalized. We will always need people to connect things; that’s the bulk of what web developers do now, even those working with frameworks like React.js. In practice, there has been—and will&nbsp;continue&nbsp;to be—a lot of overlap between the “tool designer” and “tool user” roles. That won’t change. The essence of low-code is that it allows more people to connect things and become creative. We must never undervalue that creativity, but likewise, we have to understand that more people connecting things—managers, office workers, executives—doesn’t reduce the need for professional tools, any more than the 3D printers reduced the need for manufacturing engineers.</p>



<p>The more people who are capable of connecting things, the more things need to be connected. Programmers will be needed to build everything from web widgets to the high-level tools that let citizen programmers do their work. And many citizen programmers will see ways for tools to be improved or have ideas about new tools that will help them become more productive, and will start to design and build their own tools.</p>



<h2>Rethinking Programmer Education</h2>



<p>Once we make the distinction between blue- and white-collar programmers, we can talk about what kinds of education are appropriate for the two groups. A plumber goes to a trade school and serves an apprenticeship; a designer goes to college, and may serve an internship. How does this compare to the ways programmers are educated?</p>



<p>As complex as modern web frameworks like React.js may be (and we suspect they’re a very programmerly reaction against democratization), you don’t need a degree to become a competent web developer. The educational system is beginning to shift to take this into account. Boot camps (a format probably originating with Gregory Brown’s&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/pqoJJ" target="_blank">Ruby Mendicant University</a>) are the programmer’s equivalent of trade schools. Many boot camps facilitate internships and initial jobs. Many students at boot camps already have degrees in a non-technical field, or in a technical field that’s not related to&nbsp;programming.</p>



<p>Computer science majors in colleges and universities provide the “designer” education, with a focus on theory and algorithms. Artificial intelligence is a subdiscipline that originated in academia, and is still driven by academic research. So are disciplines like bioinformatics, which straddles the boundaries between biology, medicine, and computer science. Programs like&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://datacarpentry.org/" target="_blank">Data Carpentry</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://software-carpentry.org/" target="_blank">Software Carpentry</a>&nbsp;(two of the three organizations that make up&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://carpentries.org/" target="_blank">“The Carpentries”</a>) cater specifically to graduate students who want to improve their data or programming skills.</p>



<p>This split matches a reality that we’ve always known. You’ve never needed a four-year computer science degree to get a programming job; you still don’t. There are many, many programmers who are self-taught, and some startup executives who never entered college (let alone finished it); as one programmer who left a senior position to found a successful startup once said in conversation, “I was making too much money building websites when I was in high school.” No doubt some of those who never entered college have made significant contributions in algorithms and theory.</p>



<p>Boot camps and four-year institutions both have weaknesses. Traditional colleges and universities pay little attention to the parts of the job that aren’t software development: teamwork, testing, agile processes, as well as areas of software development that are central to the industry now, such as cloud computing. Students need to learn how to use databases and operating systems effectively, not design them. Boot camps, on the other hand,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/SAF7L" target="_blank">range</a>&nbsp;from the excellent to the mediocre. Many go deep on a particular framework, like Rails or React.js, but don’t give students a broader introduction to programming. Many engage in ethically questionable practices around payment (boot camps aren’t cheap) and job placement. Picking a good boot camp may be as difficult as choosing an undergraduate college.</p>



<p>To some extent, the weaknesses of boot camps and traditional colleges can be helped through apprenticeships and internships. However, even that requires care: many companies use the language of the “agile” and CI/CD, but have only renamed their old, ineffective processes. How can interns be placed in positions where they can learn modern programming practices, when the companies in which they’re placed don’t understand those practices? That’s a critical problem, because we expect that trained programmers will, in effect, be responsible for bringing these practices to the low-code programmers.</p>



<p>Why? The promise is that low-code allows people to become productive and creative with little or no formal education. We aren’t doing anyone a service by sneaking educational requirements in through the back door. “You don’t have to know how to program, but you do have to understand deployment and testing”—that misses the point. But that’s also essential, if we want software built by low-code developers to be reliable and deployable—and if software created by citizen programmers can’t be deployed, “democratization” is a fraud. That’s another place where professional software developers fit in. We will need people who can create and maintain the pipelines by which software is built, tested, archived, and deployed. Those tools already exist for traditional code-heavy languages; but new tools will be needed for low-code frameworks. And the programmers who create and maintain those tools will need to have experience with current software development practices. They will become the new teachers, teaching everything about computing that isn’t coding.</p>



<p>Education doesn’t stop there; good professionals are always learning. Acquiring new skills will be a part of both the blue-collar and white-collar programmer experience well beyond the pervasiveness of low-code.</p>



<h2>Rethinking the Industry</h2>



<p>If programmers change, so will the software industry. We see three changes. In the last 20 years, we’ve learned a lot about managing the software development process. That’s an intentionally vague phrase that includes everything from source management (which has a history that goes back to the 1970s) to continuous deployment pipelines. And we have to ask: if useful work is coming from low-code developers, how do we maintain that? What does GitHub for Excel, LabVIEW, or GPT-3 look like? When something inevitably breaks, what will debugging and testing look like when dealing with low-code programs? What does continuous delivery mean for applications written with SAP or PageMaker? Glitch, Copilot, and Microsoft’s Power Fx are the only low-code systems we’ve discussed that can answer this question right now. Glitch fits into CI/CD practice because it’s a system for writing less code, and copying more, so it’s compatible with our current tooling. Likewise, Copilot helps you write code in a traditional programming language that works well with CI/CD tools. Power Fx fits because it’s a traditional text-based language: Excel formulas without the spreadsheet. (It’s worth noting that Excel’s&nbsp;<em>.xlsx</em>&nbsp;files aren’t amenable to source control, nor do they have great tools for debugging and testing, which are a standard part of software development.) Extending fundamental software development practices like version control, automated testing, and continuous deployment to other low-code and no-code tools sounds like a job for programmers, and one that’s still on the to-do list.</p>



<p>Making tool designers and builders more effective will undoubtedly lead to new and better tools. That almost goes without saying. But we hope that if coders become more effective, they will spend more time thinking about the code they write: how it will be used, what problems are they trying to solve, what are the ethical questions these problems raise, and so on. This industry has no shortage of badly designed and ethically questionable products. Rather than rushing a product into release without considering its implications for security and safety, perhaps making software developers more effective will let them spend more time thinking about these issues up front, and during the process of software development.</p>



<p>Finally, an inevitable shift in team structure will occur across the industry, allowing programmers to focus on solving with code what low-code solutions can’t solve, and ensuring that what is solved through low-code solutions is carefully monitored and corrected. Just as spreadsheets can be buggy and an errant decimal or bad data point can sink businesses and economies, buggy low-code programs built by citizen programmers could just as easily cause significant headaches. Collaboration—not further division—between programmers and citizen programmers within a company will ensure that low-code solutions are productive, not disruptive as programming becomes further democratized. Rebuilding teams with this kind of collaboration and governance in mind could increase productivity for companies large and small—affording smaller companies who can’t afford specialization the ability to diversify their applications, and allowing larger companies to build more impactful and ethical software.</p>



<h2>Rethinking Code Itself</h2>



<p>Still, when we look at the world of low-code and no-code programming, we feel a nagging disappointment. We’ve made great strides in producing libraries that reduce the amount of code programmers need to write; but it’s still programming, and that’s a barrier in itself. We’ve seen limitations in other low-code or no-code approaches; they’re typically “no code until you need to write code.” That’s&nbsp;progress, but only progress of a sort. Many of us would rather program in Python than in PL/I or Fortran, but that’s a difference of quality, not of kind. Are there any ways to rethink programming at a fundamental level? Can we ever get beyond 80-character lines that, no matter how good our IDEs and refactoring tools might be, are really just virtual punch cards?</p>



<p>Here are a few ideas.</p>



<p>Brett Victor’s&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://dynamicland.org/" target="_blank">Dynamicland</a>&nbsp;represents a complete rethinking of programming. It rejects the notion of programming with virtual objects on laptop screens; it’s built upon the idea of working with real-world objects, in groups, without the visible intermediation of computers. People “play” with objects on a tabletop; sensors detect and record what they’re doing with the objects. The way objects are arranged become the programs. It’s more like playing with Lego blocks (in real life, not some virtual world), or with paper and scissors, than the programming that we’ve become accustomed to. And the word “play” is important. Dynamicland is all about reenvisioning computing as play rather than work. It’s the most radical attempt at no-code programming that we’ve seen.</p>



<p>Dynamicland is a “50-year project.” At this point, we’re 6 years in: only at the beginning. Is it the future? We’ll see.</p>



<p>If you’ve followed quantum computing, you may have seen quantum circuit notation (shown in&nbsp;Figure 5), a way of writing quantum programs that looks sort of like music: a staff composed of lines representing qubits, with operations connecting those lines. We’re not going to discuss quantum programming; we find this notation suggestive for other reasons. Could it represent a different way to look at the programming enterprise? Kevlin Henney has&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/5geqD" target="_blank">talked about programming as managing space and time</a>. Traditional programming languages are (somewhat) good about space; languages like C, C++, and Java require you to define datatypes and data structures. But we have few tools for managing time, and (unsurprisingly) it’s hard to write concurrent code. Music is all about time management. Think of a symphony and the 100 or so musicians as independent “threads” that have to stay synchronized—or think of a jazz band, where improvisation is central, but synchronization remains a must. Could a music-aware notation (such as&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://sonic-pi.net/" target="_blank">Sonic Pi</a>) lead to new ways for thinking about concurrency? And would such a notation be more approachable than virtual punch cards? This rethinking will&nbsp;inevitably&nbsp;fail if it tries too literally to replicate staves, note values, clefs and such; but it may be a way to free ourselves from thinking about business as usual.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/lcdp_0105-1048x222.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14099" srcset="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/lcdp_0105-1048x222.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/lcdp_0105-300x64.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/lcdp_0105-768x163.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/lcdp_0105.png 1430w" sizes="(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px" /><figcaption><em>Figure 5.&nbsp;Quantum circuit notation (source:&nbsp;</em><a href="https://oreil.ly/WGQl6">Programmi</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://oreil.ly/WGQl6" target="_blank">ng Quantum Computers</a><em>)</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Here’s an even more radical thought. At an early Biofabricate conference, a speaker from Microsoft was talking about tools for programming DNA. He said something mind-blowing: we often say that DNA is a “programming language,” but it has control structures that are unlike anything in our current programming languages. It’s not clear that those programming structures are representable in a text. Our present notion of computation—and, for that matter, of what’s “computable”—derives partly from the Turing machine (a thought experiment) and Von Neumann’s notion of how to build such a machine. But are there other kinds of machines? Quantum computing says so; DNA says so. What are the limits of our current understanding of computing, and what kinds of notation will it take to push beyond those limits?</p>



<p>Finally, programming has been dominated by English speakers, and programming languages are, with few exceptions, mangled variants of English. What would programming look like in other languages? There are programming languages in a number of&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/f3LYk" target="_blank">non-English languages</a>, including Arabic, Chinese, and Amharic. But the most interesting is the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/2U70Y" target="_blank">Cree#</a>&nbsp;language, because it isn’t just an adaptation of a traditional programming language. Cree# tries to reenvision programming in terms of the indigenous American Cree culture, which revolves around storytelling. It’s a programming language for stories, built around the logic of stories. And as such, it’s a different way of looking at the world. That way of looking at the world might seem like an arcane curiosity (and currently Cree# is considered an “esoteric programming language”); but one of the biggest problems facing the artificial intelligence community is developing systems that can explain the reason for a decision. And explanation is ultimately about storytelling. Could Cree# provide better ways of thinking about algorithmic explainability?</p>



<h2>Where We’ve Been and Where We’re Headed</h2>



<p>Does a new way of programming increase the number of people who are able to be creative with computers? It has to; in&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/tyGvx" target="_blank">&#8220;The Rise of the No Code Economy&#8221;</a>, the authors write that relying on IT departments and professional programmers is unsustainable. We need to enable people who aren’t programmers to develop the software they need. We need to enable people to solve their own computational problems. That’s the only way “digital transformation” will happen.</p>



<p>We’ve talked about digital transformation for years, but relatively few companies have done it. One lesson to take from the COVID pandemic is that every business has to become an online business. When people can’t go into stores and restaurants, everything from the local pizza shop to the largest retailers needs to be online. When everyone is working at home, they are going to want tools to optimize their work time. Who is going to build all that software? There may not be enough programming talent to go around. There may not be enough of a budget to go around (think about small businesses that need to transact online). And there certainly won’t be the patience to wait for a project to work its way through an overworked IT department. Forget about yesterday’s arguments over whether everyone should learn to code. We are entering a business world in which almost everyone will need to code—and low-, no-, and yes-code frameworks are necessary to enable that. To enable businesses and their citizen programmers to be productive, we may see a proliferation of DSLs: domain-specific languages designed to solve specific problems. And those DSLs will inevitably evolve towards general purpose programming languages: they’ll need web frameworks, cloud capabilities, and more.</p>



<p>“Enterprise low-code” isn’t all there is to the story. We also have to consider what low-code means for professional programmers. Doing more with less? We can all get behind that. But for professional programmers, “doing more with less” won’t mean using a templating engine and a drag-and-drop interface builder to create simple database applications. These tools inevitably limit what’s&nbsp;possible—that’s precisely why they’re valuable. Professional programmers will be needed to do what the low-code users can’t. They build new tools, and make the connections between these tools and the old tools. Remember that the amount of “glue code” that connects things rises as the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/xnkka" target="_blank">square</a>&nbsp;of the number of things being&nbsp;connected, and that most of the work involved in gluing components together is&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/39TxO" target="_blank">data integration</a>, not just managing formats. Anyone concerned about computing jobs drying up should stop worrying; low-code will inevitably create more work, rather than less.</p>



<p>There’s another side to this story, though: what will the future of programming look like? We’re still working with paradigms that haven’t changed much since the 1950s. As Kevlin Henney pointed out in conversation, most of the trendy new features in programming languages were actually invented in the 1970s: iterators, foreach loops, multiple assignment, coroutines, and many more. A surprising number of these go back to the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oreil.ly/9Weex" target="_blank">CLU</a>&nbsp;language from 1975. Will we continue to reinvent the past, and is that a bad thing? Are there fundamentally different ways to describe what we want a computer to do, and if so, where will those come from? We started with the idea that the history of programming was the history of “less code”: finding better abstractions, and building libraries to implement those abstractions—and that progress will certainly continue. It will certainly be aided by tools like Copilot, which will enable subject matter experts to develop software with less help from professional programmers. AI-based coding tools might not generate “less” code–but humans won’t be writing it. Instead, they’ll be thinking and analyzing the problems that they need to solve.</p>



<p>But what happens next? A tool like Copilot can handle a lot of the “grunt work” that’s part of programming, but it’s (so far) built on the same set of paradigms and abstractions. Python is still Python. Linked lists and trees are still linked lists and trees, and getting concurrency right is still difficult. Are the abstractions we inherited from the past 70 years adequate to a world dominated by artificial intelligence and massively distributed systems?</p>



<p>Probably not. Just as the two-dimensional grid of a spreadsheet allows people to think outside the box defined by lines of computer code, and just as the circuit diagrams of LabVIEW allow engineers to envision code as wiring diagrams, what will give us new ways to be creative? We’ve touched on a few: musical notation, genetics, and indigenous languages. Music is important because musical scores are all about synchronization at scale; genetics is important because of control structures that can’t be represented by our ancient IF and FOR statements; and indigenous languages help us to realize that human activity is fundamentally about stories. There are, no doubt, more. Is low-code the future—a “better abstraction”? We don’t know, but it will almost certainly enable different code.</p>

<p>While October’s news was dominated by Facebook’s (excuse me, Meta’s) continued problems (you’d think they’d get tired of the apology tour), the most interesting news comes from the AI world. I’m fascinated by the use of large language models to analyze the “speech” of whales, and to preserve endangered human languages. It’s also important that machine learning seems to have taken a step (pun somewhat intended) forward, with robots that teach themselves to walk by trial and error, and with robots that learn how to assemble themselves to perform specific tasks.</p>

<p>The unwilling star of this month’s trends is clearly Facebook. Between reports that they knew about the damage that their applications were causing long before that damage hit the news, their continued denials and apologies, and their attempts to block researchers from studying the consequences of their products, they’ve been in the news almost every day. Perhaps the most interesting item, though, is the introduction of Ray-Ban Stories, a pair of sunglasses with a camera built in. We’ve been talking about virtual and augmented reality for years; when will it enter the mainstream? Will Stories be enough to make it cool, or will it have the same fate as Google Glass?</p>
