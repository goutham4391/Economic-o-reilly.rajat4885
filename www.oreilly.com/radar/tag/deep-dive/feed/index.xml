<p>In a recent Radar piece, I explored <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/building-a-better-middleman/" target="_blank">N-sided marketplaces and the middlemen</a> who bring disparate parties together. One such marketplace is the world of advertising, in which middlemen pair hopeful advertisers with consumer eyeballs. And this market for attention is absolutely huge, with global ad spend <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.statista.com/topics/990/global-advertising-market/#dossierKeyfigures" target="_blank">weighing in at $763 <em>billion</em> in 2021 revenues</a>.</p>



<p>Most of that money is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/worldwide-digital-ad-spending-2021" target="_blank">spent on digital ads</a>, like the ones that follow you across websites to offer you deals on items you&#8217;ve just bought. Those are typically based on your online activity. Ad networks trail behind you as you browse the web, trying to get an idea of who you are and what you&#8217;re likely to buy, so they can pair you with hopeful merchants.</p>



<p>While merchants are clearly happy with targeted ads—at least, I&#8217;d hope so, given how much they&#8217;re spending—consumers have, understandably, expressed concerns over personal privacy. Apple took note, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/facebook-says-apple-ios-privacy-change-will-cost-10-billion-this-year.html" target="_blank">limited iOS apps&#8217; ability to track users</a> across sites. Google has announced <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/google-chromes-privacy-changes-will-hit-the-web-later-this-year/" target="_blank">changes that would further limit advertisers&#8217; reach</a>. Who knows? Maybe the next step will be that the ad industry gets stronger regulations.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s also the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://thecorrespondent.com/100/the-new-dot-com-bubble-is-here-its-called-online-advertising" target="_blank">question of whether targeted advertising even works</a>.&nbsp; While the ad networks aren&#8217;t required to disclose their stats, there are even people inside those companies who think that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://theintercept.com/2020/12/24/facebook-ad-targeting-small-business/" target="_blank">their product is &#8220;almost all crap.&#8221;</a></p>



<p>Maybe it&#8217;s time for a different approach? Recently, Disney&#8217;s video streaming service, Disney+, threw its hat into the advertising ring by announcing a new ad-supported plan. (Credit where it&#8217;s due: I originally <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/medias/disney-va-lancer-une-offre-avec-de-la-publicite-1391472" target="_blank">found this in <em>Les Echos</em></a>, which may be paywalled. Here&#8217;s the official, English-language <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-to-introduce-an-ad-supported-subscription-offering-in-late-2022/" target="_blank">press release from Disney</a>.)</p>



<p>It may be easy to disregard this Disney+ move, since so much of the online world is ad-supported these days. But I think this merits more attention than it may seem on the surface.</p>



<p>To be clear: I have no inside information here. But it at least <em>looks like</em> Disney+ can run its ad platform in a fairly low-tech fashion while also preserving privacy. That&#8217;s a pretty big deal for Disney, for consumers, and for the wider space of online advertising.</p>



<h3>Everything old is new again</h3>



<p>To understand why, let&#8217;s first consider the idea of <em>&#8220;content marketing.&#8221;</em> This is a new term for the age-old practice of selling ad space next to curated content that aligns with a particular theme. For example, let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve created a magazine about cars. Motoring enthusiasts will read your magazine, which means advertisers (merchants) who want to reach them will place ads in your pages. The content is what draws readers and advertisers to the same spot.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s nice about content marketing is that the ad&#8217;s placement is based on the <em>content,</em> not the <em>specific person reading it.</em></p>



<p>This addresses the privacy concern at the core of targeted advertising, because content marketing doesn&#8217;t require that you build a detailed profile of a person based on their every browsing habit. You&#8217;re not pairing an ad to a person; you&#8217;re pairing an ad to a piece of content. So you shift your analytical focus from the reader to what they&#8217;re reading.</p>



<h3>The mouse has a large library</h3>



<p>Now, consider Disney: its catalog spans decades&#8217; worth of cartoons, tween sitcoms, and movies. Its recent acquisition of the Star Wars franchise gives it access to an even wider fanbase. And don&#8217;t forget that Disney owns ESPN, which adds sports content to the portfolio. It now makes that content available through its video-on-demand (VOD) platform of Disney+.</p>



<p>Disney already has to keep track of that catalog of content as part of its day-to-day business, which means we can reasonably assume that every show, movie, and sporting event on Disney+ has been assigned some number of descriptive tags or labels.</p>



<p>From the perspective of content marketing, all of this adds up to Disney+ being able to place ads on that content without having to do much extra work. The parent company, Disney, already owns the content and it&#8217;s already been tagged. The depth and breadth of the video catalog will certainly attract a large number and wide variety of viewers. That shifts the heavy lifting to the ad-matching system, which connects advertisers with the content.</p>



<h3>Tracking your ad budget</h3>



<p>You&#8217;ve likely heard the John Wanamaker adage: &#8220;Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is, I don&#8217;t know which half.&#8221; It&#8217;s a well-founded complaint about billboard or magazine advertising, since an advertiser can&#8217;t really tell how many people saw a given ad.</p>



<p>(Some early advertising pioneers, David Ogilvy among them, learned to supply coupons with print ads so stores could track which one had resonated the most. While this added a new level of analytical rigor to the field, it still wasn&#8217;t a perfect solution to Wanamaker&#8217;s plight.)</p>



<p>Delivering content-based ads through a well-curated streaming platform addresses that somewhat. Disney+ can provide an advertiser a detailed analysis of their ad spend without revealing any individual&#8217;s identity: <em>&#8220;N number of people watched Variant V, your ad for Product P, during Show S, with the following breakdowns for time of day&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>



<p>And that leads me to my next point:</p>



<h3>Minimal ML/AI</h3>



<p>When you review the setup—a curated and labeled catalog, with broad-brush marketing characteristics—Disney+ has the ability to run this ad service using minimal ML/AI.</p>



<p>(Once again: I&#8217;m speculating from the outside here. I don&#8217;t know for sure how much ML/AI Disney+ is using or plans to use. I&#8217;m working through one hypothetical-yet-seemingly-plausible scenario.)</p>



<p>Disney+ can use those content labels—&#8221;pro football,&#8221; &#8220;tween comedy,&#8221; &#8220;gen-X cartoon&#8221;—to pair a piece of content with an advertisement. They may not get a <em>perfect</em> hit rate on these ads; but given that they&#8217;re building on top of work they&#8217;ve already done (the catalog and the streaming platform) then the ad system can run at a relatively low cost. And providing stats to advertisers is a matter of counting. Since those calculations are so trivial, I expect the toughest part of that BI will be scaling it to Disney&#8217;s audience size.</p>



<p>Can Disney+ still use ML/AI in places? They most certainly <em>can,</em> but they don&#8217;t <em>have to.</em> Disney+ has the option to run this using a smaller team of data scientists and a far smaller data analysis infrastructure. Whether you call this &#8220;smaller budget&#8221; or &#8220;higher margins,&#8221; the net effect is the same: the company ends the day with money in its pocket.</p>



<p>Disney+ can task that ML team with building models that better tag content, or that improve matches between content and advertisers. They don&#8217;t have to spend money analyzing the specific actions of a specific individual in the hopes of placing ads.</p>



<h3>Future-proofing the ad system</h3>



<p>Assuming that the Disney+ ad system will indeed run on a content marketing concept, that means the company has one more card to play: They have just sidestepped potential future privacy laws that limit the use of personal information.</p>



<p>Yes, Disney+ can get a person&#8217;s contact information when they subscribe to the service. Yes, the company can track customer behavior on- and off-platform, through a mix of first- and third-party data. But, contrary to targeted advertising, they don&#8217;t <em>need</em> all of that to run ads. All the company needs is to pair content with an advertisement. Given that this is the modern-day equivalent of a billboard or newspaper article, I imagine it would be difficult for Disney+ to run afoul of any present-day or upcoming privacy regulation with such an ad setup.</p>



<h3>There&#8217;s still some room for trouble&#8230;</h3>



<p>Going back to our car magazine example, Disney&#8217;s library is the equivalent of hundreds or even thousands of magazines. And if a single magazine is a hint as to a single interest, what can a larger number of magazines tell us?</p>



<p>By tracking what content a person watches, how they watch it (phone, tablet, TV), and what time of day, Disney+ could infer quite a bit about that person and household: the number and age of adults; marital or relationship status; age and number of children; whether this is a multi-generational household; and even some clues as to viewers&#8217; gender. (I emphasize the term &#8220;infer&#8221; here, since it would hardly be perfect.)</p>



<p>In turn, Disney <em>could</em> use this for ad targeting, or to provide even more-detailed breakdowns to advertisers, or even find ways to share the data with other companies. This could get creepy quickly, so let&#8217;s hope they don&#8217;t take this route. And based on what we&#8217;ve covered thus far, Disney+ has every opportunity to run an ad network that preserves a reasonable amount of privacy.</p>



<h3>Could the tail someday wag the dog?</h3>



<p>Another possible wrinkle would be in how advertising weighs on future content.</p>



<p>Disney already has a good eye for what people will want to watch. And right now, those viewers are Disney&#8217;s customers. But when Disney+ becomes an ad marketplace, they&#8217;ll officially be a middleman, which means they&#8217;ll have to keep both sides of the ad equation happy. At what point does Disney use the Disney+ advertising as a compass, feeding back into decisions around what content to create?</p>



<p>And would Disney ever stretch beyond its own character lines, to build TV and movies around someone <em>else&#8217;s</em> toys?&nbsp; It&#8217;s not too far-fetched of an idea. In <em>The Great Beanie Baby Bubble,</em> author Zac Bisonette points out that:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>[A TV show deal] was the kind of product-based programming that was responsible for billions per year in sales and could turn toys that no one wanted into hits through sheer exposure. Lines such as He-Man, My Little Pony, and the ThunderCats had all become hundred-million-dollar brands with the help of the product-based TV shows that accompanied their launches.</p></blockquote>



<p>Creating content in one side of the businesses while running ads in the other, it&#8217;s not unlike running an investment bank and retail bank under one roof: sure, it can lead to all kinds of interesting business opportunities.&nbsp; It can also lead to trouble.</p>



<p>When it comes to content marketing, you need to strike a balance: you want to create evergreen content, so you can continue to run ads. And when that content is going into the Disney catalog—some of which currently spans multiple generations—it has to be absolutely timeless. Giving in to the whims of a single advertiser, or a single fad, can lead to short-term gains but also short-lived content.</p>



<h3>Beyond the Magic Kingdom</h3>



<p>Despite those challenges, content marketing has huge potential for generating revenue, preserving privacy, and avoiding future regulation that could hinder targeted advertising. By building this system on BI and content tagging, Disney could do so at a smaller price tag than an AI-based, targeted-ad marketplace.</p>



<p>And this isn&#8217;t just a Disney opportunity. I&#8217;ve focused on them in this piece but other VOD providers have already seen the benefit in monetizing their catalog. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-04-10/the-phone-company-didn-t-destroy-hbo-will-the-cable-guy" target="_blank">According to Jason Kilar</a>, former CEO of WarnerMedia, &#8220;Close to 50% of every new [HBO Max] subscriber is choosing the ad tier. Hulu, the last stat they shared publicly, is they are north of 60%.&#8221; Amazon will rename its ad-supported IMDb TV service to Freevee. (I first saw this in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/freevee-amazon-kuendigt-deutschland-start-von-kostenlosem-streamingdienst-an-a-4bfbd854-34ca-476b-95b7-3ff5763d3966" target="_blank">Der Spiegel</a>; I&#8217;ve since found a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-amazoncom-inc-netflix-jennifer-salke-84b0978c4880366ea6bd8dfff7e77af0" target="_blank">US&nbsp; press release</a>.)&nbsp; And Netflix, long a holdout in the ad-supported space, hinted at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-19/netflix-plans-lower-priced-service-with-ads-marking-big-shift" target="_blank">plans for a similar offering</a>.</p>



<p>To be clear, content marketing at this scale is not exactly a get-rich-quick scheme. It works best for groups that already have a large amount of content—video, image, text, audio—that they can monetize. This certainly holds true for the platforms I&#8217;ve just mentioned. Maybe it&#8217;s also true for your company?</p>



<p>It may require getting creative as you comb through your attic. And maybe there&#8217;s an option for a new kind of ad marketplace, one that groups people with a small amount of content into a larger content ecosystem.&nbsp;Sort of like what <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.ethicalads.io/" target="_blank">EthicalAds</a> does for developer documentation. If low-cost, non-invasive content marketing is an option, it can&#8217;t hurt to try.</p>

<p>Data scientists working in Python or R typically acquire data by way of REST APIs. Both environments provide libraries that help you make HTTP calls to REST endpoints, then transform JSON responses into dataframes. But that&#8217;s never as simple as we&#8217;d like. When you&#8217;re reading a lot of data from a REST API, you need to do it a page at a time, but pagination works differently from one API to the next. So does unpacking the resulting JSON structures. HTTP and JSON are low-level standards, and REST is a loosely-defined framework, but nothing guarantees absolute simplicity, never mind consistency across APIs.</p>



<p>What if there were a way of reading from APIs that abstracted all the low-level grunt work and worked the same way everywhere? Good news! That is exactly what <a href="https://steampipe.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Steampipe</a> does. It&#8217;s a tool that translates REST API calls directly into SQL tables. Here are three examples of questions that you can ask and answer using Steampipe.</p>



<h3>1. Twitter: What are recent tweets that mention PySpark?</h3>



<p>Here&#8217;s a SQL query to ask that question:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>select

You don&#8217;t have to make an HTTP call to that API endpoint or unpack the results, you just write a SQL query that refers to the documented columns. One of those columns,&nbsp;<code>query</code>, is special: it encapsulates Twitter&#8217;s&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/integrate/build-a-query" target="_blank">query syntax</a>. Here, we are just looking for tweets that match&nbsp;<em>PySpark</em>&nbsp;but we could as easily refine the query by pinning it to specific users, URLs, types (<code>is:retweet</code>,&nbsp;<code>is:reply</code>), properties (<code>has:mentions</code>,&nbsp;<code>has_media</code>), etc. That query syntax is the same no matter how you&#8217;re accessing the API: from Python, from R, or from Steampipe. It&#8217;s plenty to think about, and all you should really need to know when crafting queries to mine Twitter data.</p>



<h3>2. GitHub: What are repositories that mention PySpark?</h3>



<p>Here&#8217;s a SQL query to ask that question:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>select

<p>This looks very similar to the first example! In this case, the table that&#8217;s being queried,&nbsp;<a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/github/tables/github_search_repository">github_search_repository</a>, receives the output from GitHub&#8217;s&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest/search#search-repositories" target="_blank">/search/repositories</a>&nbsp;endpoint and formulates it as a table with&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/github/tables/github_search_repository#inspect" target="_blank">these columns</a>.</p>



<p>In both cases the Steampipe documentation not only shows you the schemas that govern the mapped tables, it also gives examples (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/twitter/tables/twitter_search_recent#examples" target="_blank">Twitter</a>,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/github/tables/github_search_repository#examples" target="_blank">GitHub</a>) of SQL queries that use the tables in various ways.</p>



<p>Note that these are just two of many available tables. The Twitter API is mapped to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/twitter/tables" target="_blank">7 tables</a>, and the GitHub API is mapped to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/github/tables" target="_blank">41 tables</a>.</p>



<h3>3. Twitter + GitHub: What have owners of PySpark-related repositories tweeted lately?</h3>



<p>To answer this question we need to consult two different APIs, then join their results. That&#8217;s even harder to do, in a consistent way, when you&#8217;re reasoning over REST payloads in Python or R. But this is the kind of thing SQL was born to do. Here&#8217;s one way to ask the question in SQL.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>-- find pyspark repos
with github_repos as (
  select 
    name, 
    owner_login, 
    stargazers_count 
  from 
    github_search_repository 
  where 
    query = 'pyspark' and name ~ 'pyspark'
  order by stargazers_count desc 
  limit 50
),

-- find twitter handles of repo owners
github_users as (
  select
    u.login,
    u.twitter_username
  from
    github_user u
  join
    github_repos r
  on
    r.owner_login = u.login
  where
    u.twitter_username is not null
),

-- find corresponding twitter users
  select
    id
  from
    twitter_user t
  join
    github_users g
  on
    t.username = g.twitter_username
)

-- find tweets from those users
select
  t.author-&gt;&gt;'username' as twitter_user,
  'https://twitter.com/' || (t.author-&gt;&gt;'username') || '/status/' || t.id as url,
  t.text
from
  twitter_user_tweet t
join
  twitter_userids u
on
  t.user_id = u.id
where
  t.created_at &gt; now()::date - interval '1 week'
order by
  t.author
limit 5</code></pre>



<p>Here is the answer:</p>

<p>When APIs frictionlessly become tables, you can devote your full attention to reasoning over the abstractions represented by those APIs. Larry Wall, the creator of Perl, famously said: &#8220;Easy things should be easy, hard things should be possible.&#8221; The first two examples are things that should be, and are, easy: each is just 10 lines of simple, straight-ahead SQL that requires no wizardry at all.</p>



<p>The third example is a harder thing. It would be hard in any programming language. But SQL makes it possible in several nice ways. The solution is made of concise stanzas (CTEs, Common Table Expressions) that form a pipeline. Each phase of the pipeline handles one clearly-defined piece of the problem. You can validate the output of each phase before proceeding to the next. And you can do all this with the most mature and widely-used grammar for selection, filtering, and recombination of data.</p>



<h4>Do I have to use SQL?</h4>



<p>No! If you like the idea of mapping APIs to tables, but you would rather reason over those tables in Python or R dataframes, then Steampipe can oblige. Under the covers it&#8217;s Postgres, enhanced with&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers" target="_blank">foreign data wrappers</a>&nbsp;that handle the API-to-table transformation. Anything that can connect to Postgres can connect to Steampipe, including SQL drivers like Python&#8217;s&nbsp;<code>psycopg2</code>&nbsp;and R&#8217;s&nbsp;<code>RPostgres</code>&nbsp;as well as business-intelligence tools like Metabase, Tableau, and PowerBI. So you can use Steampipe to frictionlessly consume APIs into dataframes, then reason over the data in Python or R.</p>



<p>But if you haven&#8217;t used SQL in this way before, it&#8217;s worth a look. Consider this comparison of SQL to Pandas from&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://medium.com/jbennetcodes/how-to-rewrite-your-sql-queries-in-pandas-and-more-149d341fc53e" target="_blank">How to rewrite your SQL queries in Pandas</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class=""><thead><tr><th class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">SQL</th><th class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Pandas</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">select * from airports</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">airports</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">select * from airports limit 3</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">airports.head(3)</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">select id from airports where ident = &#8216;KLAX&#8217;</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">airports[airports.ident == &#8216;KLAX&#8217;].id</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">select distinct type from airport</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">airports.type.unique()</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">select * from airports where iso_region = &#8216;US-CA&#8217; and type = &#8216;seaplane_base&#8217;</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">airports[(airports.iso_region == &#8216;US-CA&#8217;) &amp; (airports.type == &#8216;seaplane_base&#8217;)]</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">select ident, name, municipality from airports where iso_region = &#8216;US-CA&#8217; and type = &#8216;large_airport&#8217;</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">airports[(airports.iso_region == &#8216;US-CA&#8217;) &amp; (airports.type == &#8216;large_airport&#8217;)][[&#8216;ident&#8217;, &#8216;name&#8217;, &#8216;municipality&#8217;]]</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>We can argue the merits of one style versus the other, but there&#8217;s no question that SQL is the most universal and widely-implemented way to express these operations on data. So no, you don&#8217;t have to use SQL to its fullest potential in order to benefit from Steampipe. But you might find that you want to.</p>

<p>In <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="the previous article (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/building-a-better-middleman/" target="_blank">the previous article</a>, I explored the role of the middleman in a two-sided marketplace.&nbsp; The term &#8220;middleman&#8221; has a stigma to it. Mostly because, when you sit between two parties that want to interact, it&#8217;s easy to get greedy.</p>



<p>Greed will bring you profits in the short term. Probably in the long term, as well.&nbsp; As a middleman, though, your greed is an existential threat.&nbsp; When you abuse your position and mistreat the parties you connect–when your cost outweighs your value–they&#8217;ll find a way to replace you. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but it will happen.</p>



<p>Luckily, you can make money as a middleman and still keep everyone happy.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s how to create that win-win-win triangle:</p>



<h3>Keep refining your platform</h3>



<p>Running a marketplace is a game of continuous improvement. You need to keep asking yourself: <em>how can I make this better for the people who interact through the marketplace?</em></p>



<p>To start, you can look for ways to make your platform more attractive to existing customers. I emphasize <em>both</em> customers, not just one side of the marketplace. Mistreating one side to favor the other may work for a time, but it will eventually fall through. Frustration has a way of helping people overcome switching costs.</p>



<p>Some stock exchanges designate <em>market makers</em> (&#8220;specialists,&#8221; if you&#8217;re old-school)<em>,</em> firms that are always ready to both buy and sell shares of a given stock. If I want to offload a thousand shares and there&#8217;s no one who wants to buy them from me, the market maker steps in to play the role of the buyer. By guaranteeing that there will always be <em>someone</em> on the other side of the bid or ask, exchanges keep everyone happy.</p>



<p>If you constantly review how the two parties interact, you can look for opportunities to mitigate their risk, create new services, or otherwise reduce friction. Most platforms connect strangers, right?&nbsp; So if you look at your business through the lens of safety, you&#8217;ll find a lot of work to do. Note how eBay&#8217;s review system provides extra assurance for buyers and sellers to trade with people they&#8217;ve never met.&nbsp; Similarly, in the early days of online commerce, credit card issuers limited shoppers&#8217; fraud risk to just $50 per purchase.&nbsp; This improved consumers&#8217; trust in online shopping, which helped make e-commerce the everyday norm that it is today.</p>



<p>Safety improvements also extend to communications. Do the parties really <em>need</em> to swap e-mail addresses or phone numbers?&nbsp; If they&#8217;re just confirming a rideshare pickup or flirting through a dating app, probably not.&nbsp; As a middleman, you are perfectly positioned to serve as the conduit;&nbsp; one that provides an appropriate level of masking or pseudonymity.&nbsp; And the money you invest in deploying a custom messaging system or temporary phone numbers (Twilio, anyone?) will pay off in terms of improved adoption and retention.</p>



<h3>Design new products and services</h3>



<p>If you understand how your parties interact and what they want to achieve, you&#8217;re in a position to spot new product opportunities that will make your customers happy.</p>



<p>From a conversation with Cyril Nigg, Director of Analytics at Reverb, the music-gear marketplace was &#8220;founded by music makers, for music makers.&#8221;&nbsp; Musicians like to try new gear, but they want to offload it if it doesn&#8217;t pan out. Reverb has therefore built tools around pricing assistance to help musicians with their product listings: <em>You want to sell this distortion pedal within 7 days? List it as $X.</em> This extra assurance that they&#8217;ll be able to resell a piece of equipment, in short order, reduces apprehensions about buying. (Going back to the point about keeping both sides of the marketplace happy: Cyril also pointed out that a Reverb customer may act as both buyer and seller across different transactions.&nbsp; That means the company can&#8217;t skimp on one side of the experience.)</p>



<p>People on a dating site want to communicate, so an easy win there is to keep an eye on new communications tools. Maybe your platform started out with an asynchronous, text-based tool that resembled e-mail.&nbsp; Can you add an option for real-time chat?&nbsp; What would it take to move up to voice? And ultimately, video? Each step in the progression requires advances in technology, so you may have to wait before you can actually deploy something. But if you can envision the system you want, you can keep an eye on the tech and be poised to pounce when it is generally available.</p>



<p>Unlike dating sites, financial exchanges are marketplaces for opposing views. One person thinks that some event will happen, they seek a counterpart who thinks that it will not, and fate determines the winner.&nbsp; This can be as vanilla as people buying or selling shares of stock, where the counterparties believe the share price will rise or fall, respectively.&nbsp; You also see situations that call for more exotic tools.&nbsp; In the lead-up to what would become the 2008 financial crisis, investors wanted to stake claims around mortgage-backed securities but there wasn&#8217;t a way to express the belief that those prices would fall. In response to this desire, a group of banks dusted off the credit default swap (CDS) concept and devised a standard, easily-tradable contract.&nbsp; Now there was a way for people to take either side of the trade, and for the banks to collect fees in the middle.&nbsp; A win-win-win situation.</p>



<p>(Well, the actual <em>trade</em> was a win-win-win. The long-term <em>outcome</em> was more of a lose-lose-win. Mortgage defaults rose, sending prices for the associated mortgage-backed securities into decline, leading to big payouts for the &#8220;I told you this was going to happen&#8221; side of each CDS contract. The banks that served double-duty as both market participant <em>and</em> middleman took on sizable losses as a result. Let this be a lesson to you: part of why a middleman makes money is precisely because they have no stake in the long-term outcome of putting the parties together. Stay in the middle if you want to play it safe.)</p>



<p>Granted, you don&#8217;t have to roll out every possible product or feature on your first day. You have to let the marketplace grow and mature somewhat, to see what will actually be useful. Still, you want to plan ahead. As you watch the marketplace, you will spot opportunities well in advance, so you can position yourself to implement them before the need is urgent.</p>



<h3>Focus on your business</h3>



<p>Besides making things easier for customers, being a better middleman means improving how your business runs.</p>



<p>To start, identify and eliminate inefficiencies in your operations.&nbsp;I don&#8217;t mean that you should cut corners, as that will come back to bite you later.&nbsp; I mean that you can check for genuine money leaks. The easy candidates will be right there on your balance sheet: have you actually used Service ABC in the last year?&nbsp; If not, maybe it&#8217;s time to cut it. Is there an equivalent to Service XYZ at a lower price? Once you&#8217;ve confirmed that the cheaper service is indeed a suitable replacement, it&#8217;s time to make the switch.</p>



<p>A more subtle candidate is your codebase.&nbsp;Custom code is a weird form of debt. It requires steady, ongoing maintenance just like payments in a loan. It may also require disruptive changes if you encounter a bug. (Imagine that your mortgage lender occasionally demanded a surprise lump sum in mid-month.) Can you replace that home-grown system with an off-the-shelf tool or a third-party service, for a cheaper and more predictable payment schedule?</p>



<p>You also want to check on the size of your total addressable market (TAM).&nbsp; What happens when you&#8217;ve reached everyone who will ever join? It&#8217;s emotionally reassuring to tell yourself that the entire planet will use your service, sure.&nbsp;But do you really want to base revenue projections on customers you can&#8217;t realistically acquire or retain? At some point, your customer numbers will plateau (and, after that, sink). You need to have a difficult conversation with yourself, your leadership team, and your investors around how you&#8217;ll handle that. And you need to have that conversation well in advance. Once you hit that limit on your TAM, you&#8217;ll need to be ready to deliver improvements that reduce churn.&nbsp;Perhaps you can offer new services, which may extend your addressable market into new territory, but even that has its limits.</p>



<p>What are you doing for risk management?&nbsp;A risk represents a possible future entry on your balance sheet, one of indeterminate size. Maybe it&#8217;s a code bug that spirals out of control under an edge case.&nbsp;Or a lingering complaint that blossoms into a full-scale PR issue. To be blunt: good risk management will save you money. Possibly lots of money.&nbsp;While it&#8217;s tempting to let some potential problems linger, understand that it&#8217;s easier and cheaper to address them early and on your own schedule.&nbsp;That&#8217;s much nicer than being under pressure to fix a surprise in real-time.</p>



<p>Sharp-eyed readers will catch that subtle tradeoff between &#8220;addressing inefficiencies&#8221; and &#8220;proactively mitigating risks.&#8221;&nbsp;Risk management often requires that you leave extra slack in the system, such as higher staff headcount, or extra machines that mostly sit idle.&nbsp;This slack serves as a cushion in the event of a surge in customer activity but it also costs money.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no easy answer here. It&#8217;s a blend of art and science to spot the difference between slack and waste.</p>



<p>Most of all, as a marketplace, you want to mature with your customers and the field overall. The term &#8220;innovate&#8221; gets some much-deserved flack, but it&#8217;s not complete hogwash. Be prepared to invest in research so you can see what changes are on the horizon, and then adapt accordingly. Also, keep an eye on the new features your customers are asking for, or the complaints they raise about your service.&nbsp;You&#8217;ll&nbsp; otherwise fall into the very trap described in <em>The Innovator&#8217;s Dilemma</em>. Don&#8217;t become the slow-moving, inattentive behemoth that some nimble upstart will work to unseat.</p>



<h3>Use technology as a force multiplier</h3>



<p>Bad middlemen squeeze the parties they connect; good middlemen squeeze technology.</p>



<p>Done well, technology is a source of asymmetric advantage. Putting code in the right places allows you to accomplish more work, more consistently, with fewer people, and in less time. All of the efficiencies you get through code will leave more money to split between yourself and your customers.&nbsp; That is a solid retention strategy.</p>



<p>To start, you can apply software to real and artificial scarcity that exists in other middlemen.&nbsp;A greenfield operation can start with lower headcount, less (or zero!) office space, and so on.</p>



<p>Tech staffing, for example, is a matching problem at its core.&nbsp;A smart staffing firm would start with self-service search tools so a company could easily find people to match their open roles. No need to interact with a human recruiter. It could also standardize contract language to reduce legal overhead (no one wants a thousand slightly-different contracts laying around, anyway) and use electronic signatures to make it easier to store paperwork for future reference.</p>



<p>You don&#8217;t even have to do anything fancy. Sometimes, the very act of putting something online is a huge step up from the incumbent solution. Craigslist, simply by running classified ads on a website, gave people a much-improved experience over the print-newspaper version. People had more space to write (goodbye, obscure acronyms), had search functionality (why skim all the listings to find what you&#8217;re after?), and could pull their ad when it had been resolved (no more getting phone calls for an extra week just because the print ad is still visible).</p>



<p>Technology also makes it easier to manage resources. Love or loathe them, rideshare companies like Lyft and Uber can scale to a greater number of drivers and riders than the old-school taxi companies that rely on radio dispatch and flag-pulls. And they can do it with less friction. Why call a company and tell them your pickup location, when an app can use your phone&#8217;s GPS? And why should that dispatcher have to radio around in search of a driver? To arrange a ride, you need to match three elements–pickup location, dropoff location, and number of passengers–to an available driver. This is a trivial effort for a computer. Throw in mobile apps for drivers and passengers, and you have a system that can scale very well.</p>



<p>(Some may argue that the rideshare companies get extra scale because their drivers are classified as independent contractors, and because they don&#8217;t require expensive taxi medallions. I don&#8217;t disagree. I just want to point out that the companies&#8217; technology is also a strong enabler.)</p>



<p>Being at the center of the marketplace means you get to see the entire system at once. You can analyze the data around customer activity, and pass on insights to market participants to make their lives easier. Airbnb, for example, has deep insight into how different properties perform. Their research team determined that listings with high-quality photos tend to earn more revenue. They publicized this information to help hosts and, to sweeten the deal, the company then built a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.airbnb.com/d/pro-photography" target="_blank">service to connect hosts with professional photographers</a>.</p>



<p>What about ML/AI? While I hardly believe that it&#8217;s ready to eat <em>every</em> job, I do see <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://qethanm.cc/2021/10/18/human-ai-interaction-exoskeletons-sidekicks-and-blinking-lights/" target="_blank">opportunities for AI to make a smaller team of people more effective</a>.&nbsp;ML models are well-suited for decisions that are too fuzzy or cumbersome to be expressed as hard rules in software, but not so nuanced that they require human judgment.&nbsp;Putting AI in the seat for those decisions frees up your team for things that genuinely merit a human&#8217;s eyes and expertise.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve argued before that a lot of machine learning is high-powered matching. What is &#8220;classification,&#8221; if not rating one item&#8217;s similarity to an archetype?&nbsp; A marketplace that deals in the long tail of goods can use ML to help with that matching.</p>



<p>Take Reverb, where most pieces of gear are unique but still similar to other items. They&#8217;re neither completely fungible, nor completely non-fungible.&nbsp; They&#8217;re sort of <em>semi-</em>fungible. To simplify search, then, Director of Analytics Cyril Nigg says that the company groups related items into ML-based <em>canonical products</em> (where some specific Product X is really part of a wider Canonical Product Y).&nbsp;&#8220;[We use] ML to match listings to a product–say, matching on title, price point, or some other attribute. This tells us, with a high degree of confidence, that a seller&#8217;s used Fender guitar is actually an American Standard Stratocaster. Now that we know the make and model, a buyer can easily compare all the different listings within that product to help them find the best option. This ML system learns over time, so that a seller can upload a listing and the system can file it under the proper canonical product.&#8221;</p>



<p>Machine-based matching works for food as well as guitars. Resham Sarkar heads up data science at Slice, which gives local pizzerias the tools, technology and guidance they need to thrive. In a 2021 interview, she told me how her team applies ML to answer the age-old question: <em>will Person X enjoy Pizza Y at Restaurant Z?</em> Slice&#8217;s recommendations give eaters the confidence to try a new flavor in a new location, which helps them (maybe they&#8217;ll develop a new favorite) and also helps pizzerias (they get new customers). This is especially useful when a pizza lover lands in a new city and doesn&#8217;t know where to get their fix.</p>



<p>Any discussion of technology wouldn&#8217;t be complete without a nod to emerging tech. Yes, keeping up with the Shiny New Thing of the Moment means having to wade through plenty of hype. But if you look closely, you may also find some real game-changers for your business. This was certainly true of the 1990s internet boom. We&#8217;ve seen it in the past decade of what we now call AI, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/rebranding-data/" target="_blank">across all of its rebrandings</a>. And yes, I expect that blockchain technologies will prove more useful than the curmudgeons want to let on.&nbsp; (Even NFTs. Or, <em>especially</em> NFTs.)</p>



<p>Skip past the success stories and vendor pitches, though. Do your own homework on what the new technology really is and what it can do. Then, engage an expert to help you fill in the gaps and sort out what is possible with <em>your</em> business. The way a new technology addresses your challenges may not align with whatever is being hyped in the news, but who cares? All that matters is that it drives improvements for your use cases.</p>



<h3>Watch your tech</h3>



<p>Technology is a double-edged sword. It&#8217;s like using leverage in the stock market: employing software or AI exposes you to higher highs when things go right, but also lower lows when things unravel.</p>



<p>One benefit to employing people to perform a task is that they can notice when something is wrong and then stop working. A piece of code, by comparison, has no idea that it is operating out of its depth. The same tools that let you do so much more, with far fewer people, also expose you to a sizable risk: one bug or environmental disconnect can trigger a series of errors, at machine speeds, cascading into a massive failure.</p>



<p>All it takes is for a few smaller problems to collide. Consider the case of Knight Capital. This experienced, heavyweight market-maker once managed $21BN in daily transaction volume on the NYSE. One day in 2012, an inconsistent software deployment met a branch of old code, which in turn collided with a new order type on the exchange. This led to a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.henricodolfing.com/2019/06/project-failure-case-study-knight-capital.html" target="_blank">meltdown</a> in which <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2013/34-70694.pdf" target="_blank">Knight Capital lost $440M in under an hour</a>.</p>



<p>The lesson here is that some of the money you save from reduced headcount should be reinvested in the company in the form of people and tools to keep an eye on the larger system. You&#8217;ll want to separate responsibilities in order to provide checks and balances, such as assigning someone who is not a developer to manage and review code deployments. Install monitors that provide fine-grained information about the state of your systems. Borrowing a line from a colleague: you can almost never have too many dimensions of data when troubleshooting.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll also need people to step in when someone gets caught in your web of automation. Have you ever called a company&#8217;s customer service line, only to wind up in a phone-tree dead-end? That can be very frustrating. You don&#8217;t want that for <em>your</em> customers, so you need to build escape hatches that route them to a person. That holds for your AI-driven chatbot as much as your self-help customer service workflows. And especially for any place where people can report a bug or an emergency situation.</p>



<p>Most of all, this level of automation requires a high-caliber team. Don&#8217;t skimp on hiring. Pay a premium for very experienced people to build and manage your technology. If you can, hire someone who has built trading systems on Wall St.&nbsp;That culture is wired to identify and handle risk in complex, automated systems where there is a lot of real money at stake.&nbsp; And they have seen technology fail in ways that you cannot imagine.</p>



<h3>Markets, everywhere</h3>



<p>I&#8217;ve often said that problems in technology are rarely tech-related; they&#8217;re people-related.&nbsp;The same holds for building a marketplace, where the big problem is really human greed.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t fall for the greed trap. You can certainly run the business in a way that brings you revenue, keeps customers happy, and attracts new prospects. Identify inefficiencies in your business operations, and keep thinking of ways to make the platform better for your customers. That&#8217;s it.&nbsp; A proper application of software and AI, risk management, and research into emerging technologies should help you with both. And the money you save, you can split with your user base.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re willing to blur the lines a little, you will probably find markets in not-so-obvious places. An airline sits between passengers and destinations. Grocery stores sit between shoppers and suppliers. Employers sit between employees and clients. And so on. Once you find the right angle, you can borrow ideas from the established, well-run middlemen to improve your business.</p>

<p>What comes to mind when you hear the term &#8220;two-sided market?&#8221; Maybe you imagine a Party A who needs something, so they interact with Party B who provides it, and that&#8217;s that.&nbsp; Despite the number &#8220;two&#8221; in the name, there&#8217;s actually someone else involved: the <em>middleman</em>.&nbsp; This entity sits between the parties to make it easier for them to interact. (We can generalize that &#8220;two&#8221; to some arbitrary number and call this an <em>N-sided market</em> or <em>multi-sided marketplace</em>. But we&#8217;ll focus on the two-sided form for now.)</p>



<p>Two-sided markets are a fascinating study. They are also quite common in the business world, and therefore, so are middlemen. Record labels, rideshare companies, even dating apps all fall under this umbrella.&nbsp; The role has plenty of perks, as well as some sizable pitfalls.&nbsp; &#8220;Middleman&#8221; often carries a negative connotation because, in all fairness, some of them provide little value compared to what they ask in return.</p>



<p>Still, there&#8217;s room for everyone involved—Party A, Party B, and the middleman—to engage in a happy and healthy relationship.&nbsp; In this first article, I&#8217;ll explain more about the middleman&#8217;s role and the challenges they face.&nbsp; In the next article, I&#8217;ll explore what it takes to make a better middleman and how technology can play a role.</p>



<h2>Paving the Path</h2>



<p>When I say that middlemen make interactions easier, I mean that they address a variety of barriers:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Discovery: &#8220;Where do I find the other side of my need or transaction?&#8221;</strong> Dating apps like OKCupid, classified ads services such as Craigslist, and directory sites like Angi (formerly Angie&#8217;s List) are all a twist on a search engine. Party A posts a description of themself or their service, Party B scrolls and sifts the list while evaluating potential matches for fit.<br></li><li><strong>Matching: &#8220;Should we interact? Are our needs compatible?&#8221;</strong> Many middlemen that help with discovery also handle the matching for you, as with ride-share apps.&nbsp; Instead of you having to scroll through lists of drivers, Uber and Lyft use your phone&#8217;s GPS to pair you with someone nearby.&nbsp; (Compared to the Discovery case, Matching works best when one or both counterparties are easily interchangeable.)<br></li><li><strong>Standardization: &#8220;The middleman sets the rules of engagement, so we all know what to expect.&#8221;</strong>&nbsp; A common example would be when a middleman like eBay sets the accepted methods of payment.&nbsp; By narrowing the scope of what&#8217;s possible—by limiting options—the middleman standardizes how the parties interact.<br></li><li><strong>Safety: &#8220;I don&#8217;t have to know you in order to exchange money with you.&#8221;</strong> Stock market exchanges and credit card companies build trust with Party A and Party B, individually, so the two parties (indirectly) trust each other through the transitive property.<br></li><li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> &#8220;You two already know each other; I&#8217;ll insert myself into the middle, to make the relationship smoother.&#8221; Stripe and Squarespace make it easier for companies to sell goods and services by handling payments.&nbsp; And then there&#8217;s Squire, which co-founder Songe Laron describes as the &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://youtu.be/5R_sya8bFP8?t=21" target="_blank">operating system for the barber shop</a>, [handling] everything from the booking, to the payment, to the point of sales system, to payroll,&#8221; and a host of other frictions between barber and customer.&nbsp; In all cases, each party gets to focus on what it does best (selling goods or cutting hair) while the middleman handles the drudgework.</li></ul>



<h2>Nice Work, If You can Get It</h2>



<p>As far as their business model, middlemen usually take a cut of transactions as value moves from Party A to Party B. And this arrangement has its benefits.</p>



<p>For one, you&#8217;re first in line to get paid: Party A pays you, you take a cut, then you pass the rest on to Party B.&nbsp; Record labels and book publishers are a common example.&nbsp; They pair a creator with an audience.&nbsp; All of the business deals for that creator&#8217;s work run through the middleman, who collects the revenue from sales and takes their share along the way.</p>



<p>(The music biz is littered with stories of artists getting a raw deal—making a small percentage of revenue from their albums, while the label takes the lion&#8217;s share—but that&#8217;s another story.)</p>



<p>Then there&#8217;s the opportunity for recurring revenue, if Party A and Party B have an ongoing relationship.&nbsp; Companies often turn to tech staffing agencies to find staff-augmentation contractors.&nbsp; Those agencies typically take a cut for the entire duration of the project or engagement, which can run anywhere from a few weeks to more than a decade.&nbsp; The staffing agency makes one hell of a return on their efforts when placing such a long-term contractor. Nice work, if you can get it.</p>



<p>Staffing agencies may have to refund a customer&#8217;s money if a contractor performs poorly.&nbsp; Some middlemen, however, make money no matter how the deal ultimately turns out.&nbsp; Did I foolishly believe my friend&#8217;s hot stock tip, in his drunken reverie, and pour my savings into a bad investment? Well, NYSE isn&#8217;t going to refund my money, which means they aren&#8217;t about to lose their cut.</p>



<p>A middleman also gets a bird&#8217;s-eye view of the relationships it enables.&nbsp; It sees who interacts with whom, and how that all happens.&nbsp; Middlemen that run online platforms have the opportunity to double-dip on their revenue model: first by taking their cut from an interaction, then by collecting and analyzing data around each interaction.&nbsp; Everything from an end-user&#8217;s contact or demographic details, to exploring patterns of how they communicate with other users, can be packaged up and resold.&nbsp; (This is, admittedly, a little shady. We&#8217;ll get to middlemen&#8217;s abuse of privilege shortly.)</p>



<h2>Saddling Some Burdens, Too</h2>



<p>Before you rush out to build your own middleman company, recognize that it isn&#8217;t all easy revenue.&nbsp; You first need to breathe the platform into existence, so the parties can interact.&nbsp; Depending on the field, this can involve a significant outlay of capital, time, and effort.&nbsp; Then you need to market the platform so that everyone knows where to go to find the Party B to their Party A.</p>



<p>Once it&#8217;s up and running, maintenance costs can be low if you keep things simple.&nbsp; (Consider the rideshare companies that own the technology platform, but not the vehicles in which passengers ride.) But until you reach that cruising altitude, you&#8217;re crossing your fingers that things pan out in your favor.&nbsp; That can mean a lot of sleepless nights and stressful investor calls.</p>



<p>The middleman&#8217;s other big challenge is that they need to keep all of those <em>N</em> sides of the N-sided market happy.&nbsp; The market only exists because all of the parties want to come together, and your service persists only because they want to come together through you.&nbsp; If one side gets mad and leaves, the other side(s) will soon follow.&nbsp; Keeping the peace can be a touchy balancing act.</p>



<p>Consider Airbnb.&nbsp; Early in the pandemic they earned praise from guests by allowing them to cancel certain bookings without penalty.&nbsp; It then passed those &#8220;savings&#8221; on to hosts, who weren&#8217;t too happy about the lost revenue.&nbsp; (Airbnb later created a fund to support hosts, but some say it still fell short.)&nbsp; The action sent a clear—though, likely, unintentional and incorrect—message that Airbnb valued guests more than hosts.&nbsp; A modern-day version of robbing Peter to pay Paul.</p>



<p>Keeping all sides happy is a tough line for a middleman to walk.&nbsp; Mohambir Sawhney, from Northwestern University&#8217;s McCormick Foundation, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://youtu.be/yverNV9Tzi4?t=290" target="_blank">summed this up well</a>: &#8220;In any two-sided market, you always have to figure out who you&#8217;re going to subsidize more, and who you&#8217;re going to actually screw more.&#8221; It&#8217;s easy for outsiders to say that Airbnb should have just eaten the losses—refunded guests&#8217; money while letting hosts keep their take—but that sounds much easier said than done.&nbsp; In the end, the company still has to subsidize <em>itself,</em> right?</p>



<p>The subsidize versus screw decision calculus gets even more complicated when one side only <em>wants</em> you but doesn&#8217;t <em>need</em> you.&nbsp; In the Airbnb case, the company effectively serves as a marketing arm and payments processor for property owners.&nbsp; Any sufficiently motivated owner is just one step away from handling that on their own, so even a small negative nudge can send them packing.&nbsp; (In economics terms, we say that those owners&#8217; <em>switching costs</em> are low.)</p>



<p>The same holds for the tech sector, where independent contractors can bypass staffing firms to hang their own shingle.&nbsp; Even rideshare drivers have a choice.&nbsp; While it would be tougher for them to get their own taxi medallion, they can switch from Uber to Lyft.&nbsp; Or, as many do, they can sign up with both services so that switching costs are effectively zero: &#8220;delete Uber app, keep the Lyft app running, done.&#8221;</p>



<h2>Making Enemies</h2>



<p>Even with those challenges, delivering on the middleman&#8217;s <em>raison d&#8217;être</em>—&#8221;keep all parties happy&#8221;—should be a straightforward affair.&nbsp; (I don&#8217;t say &#8220;easy,&#8221; just &#8220;straightforward.&#8221; There&#8217;s a difference.) Parties A and B clearly want to be together, you&#8217;re helping them be together, so the experience should be a win all around.</p>



<p>Why, then, do middlemen have such a terrible reputation?&nbsp; It mostly boils down to greed.</p>



<p>Once a middleman becomes a sufficiently large and/or established player, they become the <em>de facto</em> place for the parties to meet.&nbsp; This is a near-monopoly status. The middleman no longer needs to care about keeping one or even both parties happy, they figure, because those groups either interact through the middleman or they don&#8217;t interact at all. (This also holds true for the near-cartel status of a group of equally unpleasant middlemen.)</p>



<p>Maybe the middleman suddenly raises fees, or sets onerous terms of service, or simply mistreats one side of the pairing.&nbsp; This raises the dollar, effort, and emotional cost to the parties since they don&#8217;t have many options to leave.</p>



<p>Consider food-delivery apps, which consumers love but can <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://get.doordash.com/en-us/products/marketplace" target="_blank">take as much as a 30% cut</a> of an order&#8217;s revenue.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a large bite, but easier to swallow when a restaurant has a modest take-away business alongside a much larger dine-in experience. It&#8217;s quite another story when take-away is suddenly your <em>entire</em> business and you&#8217;re still paying rent on the empty dining room space. Most restaurants found themselves in just this position early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Some hung signs in their windows, asking customers to call them directly instead of using the delivery apps.</p>



<p>Involving a middleman in a relationship can also lead to weird principal-agent problems.&nbsp; Tech staffing agencies (even those that paint themselves as &#8220;consultancies&#8221;) have earned a special place here.&nbsp; Big companies hand such &#8220;preferred vendors&#8221; a strong moat by requiring contractors to pass through them in lieu of establishing a direct relationship. Since the middlemen can play this <em>Work Through Us, or Don&#8217;t Work at All</em> card, it&#8217;s no surprise that they&#8217;ve been known to take as much as 50% of the money as it passes from client to contractor.&nbsp; The client companies don&#8217;t always know this, so they are happy that the staffing agency has helped them find software developers and DBAs. The contractors, many of whom are aware of the large cuts, aren&#8217;t so keen on the arrangement.</p>



<p>This is on top of limiting a tech contractor&#8217;s ability to work through a competing agency.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve seen everything from thinly-veiled threats (&#8220;if the client sees your resume from more than one agency, they&#8217;ll just throw it out&#8221;) to written agreements (&#8220;this contract says you won&#8217;t go through another agency to work with this client&#8221;). &nbsp; What if you&#8217;ve found a different agency that will take a smaller cut, so you get more money?&nbsp; Or what if Agency 1 has done a poor job of representing you, while you know that Agency 2 will get it right?&nbsp; In both cases, the answer is: tough luck.</p>



<p>A middleman can also resort to more subtle ways to mistreat the parties.&nbsp; Uber has reportedly used a variety of techniques from behavioral science—<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/04/02/technology/uber-drivers-psychological-tricks.html" target="_blank">such as the gamification of male managers pretending to be women</a>—to encourage drivers to work more.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve also been accused of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/04/uber-said-to-use-sophisticated-software-to-defraud-drivers-passengers/" target="_blank">showing drivers and passengers different routes</a>, charging the passenger for the longer way and paying the driver for the shorter way.</p>



<h2>It&#8217;s Not All Easy Money</h2>



<p>To be fair, middlemen do earn <em>some</em> of their cut. They provide value in that they reduce friction for both the buy and sell sides of an interaction.</p>



<p>This goes above and beyond building the technology for a platform.&nbsp; Part of how the Deliveroos and Doordashes of the world connect diners to restaurants is by coordinating fleets of delivery drivers.&nbsp; It would be expensive for a restaurant to do this on their own: hiring multiple drivers, managing the schedule, accounting for demand … and hoping business stays hot so that the drivers aren&#8217;t paid to sit idle. Similarly, tech staffing firms don&#8217;t just introduce you to contract talent. They also handle time-tracking, invoicing, and legal agreements. The client company cuts one large check to the staffing firm, which cuts lots of smaller checks to the individual contractors.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t forget that handling contracts and processing payments come with extra regulatory requirements. Rules often vary by locale, and the middleman has to spend money to keep track of those rules.&nbsp; So it&#8217;s not <em>all</em> profit.</p>



<p>(They can also build tools to <em>avoid</em> rules, such as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/technology/uber-greyball-program-evade-authorities.html" target="_blank">Uber&#8217;s infamous &#8220;greyball&#8221; system</a> … but that&#8217;s another story.)</p>



<p>That said, a middleman&#8217;s benefit varies by the industry vertical and even by the client.&nbsp; Some argue that their revenue cut far exceeds the value they provide. In the case of tech staffing firms, I&#8217;ve heard plenty of complaints that recruiters take far too much money for&nbsp; just &#8220;having a phone number&#8221; (having a client relationship) and cutting a check, when it&#8217;s the contractor who does the actual work of building software or managing systems for the client.</p>



<h2>A Win-Win-Win Triangle</h2>



<p>Running a middleman has its challenges and risks.&nbsp; It can also be tempting to misuse the role&#8217;s power.&nbsp; Still, I say that there&#8217;s a way to build an N-sided marketplace where everyone can be happy.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll explore that in the next article in this series.</p>

<p>If the hype surrounding the metaverse results in something real, it could improve the way you live, work, and play. Or it could create a hellworld where you don’t get to be who you are or want to be.&nbsp; Whatever people think they’ve read, the metaverse originally imagined in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash" target="_blank">Snow Crash</a> is not a vision for an ideal future. In the novel, it’s a world that replaced the “real world” so that people would feel less bad about the reality they actually had. In the end, the story is about the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://brill.com/view/book/9781848881631/BP000011.xml" target="_blank">destabilization of the individual’s identity and implosion of traditional identities</a>, rather than the securing of a new one.</p>



<p>Even in the real world (a.k.a. meatspace), identity can be hard to pin down. You are who you are, but there are many ways you may define yourself depending on the context. In the latest metaverse discourse there has been lots of talk of virtual avatars putting on NFT-based clothing, skins, weapons, and other collectable assets, and then moving those assets around to different worlds and games without issue. Presentation is just a facet of identity, as the real-world fashion industry well knows.</p>



<p>The latest dreams of web3 include decentralized and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://tykn.tech/self-sovereign-identity/" target="_blank">self-sovereign identity</a>. But this is just re-hashing years of identity work that focuses on the how (internet standards) and rarely the why (what people need to feel comfortable with identity online). <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://secondlife.com/" target="_blank">Second Life</a> has been grappling with how people <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315529871_The_Process_of_Identity_Building_In_Second_Life" target="_blank">construct a new identity</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://medium.com/s/story/boobs-muscles-fairy-wings-everything-i-know-about-how-humans-design-their-avatar-selves-e2ebf738750e" target="_blank">present their avatars</a> since 2003.</p>



<p>There are many ways that the web today and the metaverse tomorrow will continue to integrate further with our reality:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class=""><tbody><tr><td><strong>Experiences</strong></td><td><strong>Examples</strong>  </td></tr><tr><td>Online through a laptop like the web today</td><td>Posting to Facebook, discussing work on Slack or joining a DAO on Discord.</td></tr><tr><td>Mobile devices while walking around in the real world</td><td>Seeing the comments about a restaurant while standing in front of it, getting directions to a beach or getting access to a private club via an NFT.</td></tr><tr><td>Mixed and augmented reality (MR/AR) experiences where the digital is overlaid on reality</td><td>Chatting with someone who looks like they are sitting next to you or seeing the last message you sent to someone you are talking to.</td></tr><tr><td>Fully immersive virtual reality (VR) experiences</td><td>Going to a chat room in AltspaceVR or playing a game with friends in Beatsaber.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Before we can figure out what identity means to people in “the metaverse,” we need to talk about what identity is, how we use identity in the metaverse, and how we might create systems that better realize the way people want their identities to work online.</p>



<h3>I login therefore I am</h3>



<p>When I mention identity, am I starting a philosophical discussion that answers the question “who am I?” Am I trying to figure out my place within an in-person social event? Or do you want to confirm that I meet some standard, such as being over 21?</p>



<p>All of these questions have a meaning in the digital world; most often, those questions are answered by logging in with an email address and password to get into a particular website. Over the last decade, some services like Facebook, Google, and others have started to allow you to use the identity you have with them to log into other websites.</p>



<p>Is the goal of online identity to have one overarching identity that ties everything together? Our identities are constantly renegotiated and unsaid. I don’t believe we can encode all of the information about our identities into a single digital record, even if some groups are trying. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_real-name_policy_controversy" target="_blank">Facebook’s real-name policy</a> requires you to use your legal name and makes you collapse all of your possible pseudo-identities into your legal one. If they think you aren’t using a legal name, they require you to upload a government issued document. I’d argue that because people create multiple identities even when faced with account deactivation, it is not their goal to have one single compiled identity.</p>



<h3>All of me(s)</h3>



<p>As we consider identities in the metaverse extensions to the identities we have in the real world, we need to understand that we build pseudo-identities for different interactions. My pseudo-identities for a family, work, my neighborhood, PTA, school friends, etc. all overlap to some extent. These are situations, contexts, realms, or worlds that I am part of, and that extend to the web and metaverse.</p>



<p>In most pseudo-identities there are shared parts that are the “real me,” like my name or my real likeness. Some may be closer to a “core” pseudo-identity that represents more of what I consider to be me; others may just be smaller facets. Each identity is associated with a different reputation, a different level of trust from the community, and different data (profile pictures, posts, etc.).</p>



<p>The most likely place to find our identities are:</p>



<ul><li>Lists of email and password pairs stored in our browsers</li><li>Number of groups we are part of on Facebook</li><li>Gamer tags we have on Oculus, Steam, or PSN</li><li>Discords we chat on</li><li>…and the list goes on</li></ul>



<p>Huge numbers of these identities are being created and managed by hand today. On average, a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://99firms.com/blog/how-many-email-users-are-there/#:~:text=How%20many%20email%20addresses%20does,separate%20personal%20and%20professional%20accounts." target="_blank">person has 1.75 email addresses</a> and manages <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digitalguardian.com/blog/uncovering-password-habits-are-users-password-security-habits-improving-infographic#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20a%20Dashlane%20analysis,to%20a%20single%20email%20address." target="_blank">90 online accounts</a>. It will only get more complex and stranger with the addition of the metaverse.</p>



<p>There are times that I don’t want my pseudo-identity’s reputations or information to interact with a particular context; for these cases, I’ll create a pseudo-anonymous identity. There is a lot of prior work on anonymity as a benefit:</p>



<ul><li>Balaji Srinivasan has <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urtXRg9Nl3k" target="_blank">discussed the value of an economy based on pseudonymous identities</a> as a way to “air gap” against repercussions of social problems. </li><li>Jeff Kosseff, professor and author, has recently written a book about the benefits of anonymity “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501762383/the-united-states-of-anonymous/" target="_blank">The United States of Anonymous</a>.” In a great discussion on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/03/01/techdirt-podcast-episode-313-the-united-states-of-anonymous/" target="_blank">TechDirt podcast</a> he talks about how the ability to question powers is an important aspect of the ability to be anonymous.</li><li>Christopher &#8220;moot&#8221; Poole, the creator of 4chan, has often talked about the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1UEAGCo30" target="_blank">benefits of anonymous online identities</a> including the ability to be more creative without the risk of failure. Given the large amount of harmful abuse that comes out of communities like 4chan, this argument for anonymity is questionable.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Picture1-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14345" width="582" height="354" srcset="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Picture1-1.png 977w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Picture1-1-300x183.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Picture1-1-768x468.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 582px) 100vw, 582px" /><figcaption>My many identities and overlapping zones of attributes, information, and privacy.<br></figcaption></figure>



<p>If you link one of my pseudo-identities to another pseudo-identity in a way I didn’t expect, it can feel like a violation. I expect to control the flow of information about me (see Helen Nissenbaum’s work on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_integrity" target="_blank">contextual integrity</a> for insight into a beneficial privacy framework). I don’t want my online poker group’s standing to be shown to the PTA, with which I discuss school programs. Teachers who have OnlyFans accounts have been fired when the accounts are discovered. Journalists reporting on cartel activities have been killed. Twitter personalities that use their real names can be <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing" target="_blank">doxed</a> by someone who links their Twitter profile to a street address and mobile phone number. This can have horrible consequences.</p>



<p>In the real world, we have many of these pseudo-identities and pseudo-anonymous identities. We even have an expectation of anonymity in groups like Alcoholics Anonymous and private clubs. If we look to Second Life, some people would adopt core pseudo-identities and others pseudo-anonymous identities.</p>



<p>In the online world and, eventually, the metaverse, we will have more control over the use of our identities and pseudo-identities, but possibly less ability to understand how these identities are being handled by each system we are part of. Our identities can already collide in personal devices (for example, my mobile phone) and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/communal-computing/" target="_blank">communal devices</a> (for example, the voice assistant in my kitchen around my family).</p>



<h3>How do you recognize someone in the metaverse?</h3>



<p>In the real world we recognize people by their face, and identify them by a name in our heads (if you are good at that sort of thing). We may remember the faces of some people we pass on the street, but in a city, we don’t really know most of the people who we are around.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Picture2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14346" srcset="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Picture2.png 977w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Picture2-300x92.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Picture2-768x236.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px" /><figcaption>A few of the author’s identities online and in the metaverse.<br></figcaption></figure>



<p>The person you’re communicating with may show up with a real name, a nickname, or even a pseudo-anonymous name. Their picture might be a professional photo, a candid picture, or an anime avatar, or some immersive presentation. All of these identifiers are protected by login, multi-factor authentication, or other mechanisms–yet people are hacked all the time. A site like Facebook tries to give you assurances that you are interacting with the person you think you’re interacting with; this is one justification for their real-name policy. Still, there is a difference between the logical &#8220;this is this person because Facebook says so&#8221; and the emotional &#8220;this feels like the person because my senses say so.&#8221; With improvements in immersion and building “social presence” (a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_presence_theory" target="_blank">theory of “sense of being with another”</a>), we may be tricked more easily into providing better engagement metrics for a social media site. I may even feel that AI-generated faces based on people I know are <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.pnas.org/content/119/8/e2120481119" target="_blank">more trustworthy</a> than actual images of the people themselves.</p>



<p>What if you could give your online avatar your voice, and even make it use idioms you use? This type of personal spoofing may not always be nefarious. You might just want a bot that could handle low value conversations, say with a telemarketer or bill collector.</p>



<h3>We can do better than “who can see this post”</h3>



<p>To help people grapple with the increased complexity of identity in the metaverse, we need to rethink the way we create, manage, and eventually retire our identities. It goes way beyond just choosing what clothing to wear on a virtual body. </p>



<p>When you start to add technologies that tie everything you do to a public, immutable record, you may find that something you wish could be forgotten is remembered. What should be “on the chain” and how should you decide? Codifying aspects of our reputation is a dream of web3. The creation of digitally legible reputation can cause ephemeral and unsaid aspects of our identities to be stored forever. And an immutable public record of reputation data will no doubt conflict with legislation such as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://gdpr-info.eu/" target="_blank">GDPR</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa" target="_blank">CCPA</a>.</p>



<p>The solutions to these problems are neither simple nor available today. To move in the right direction we should consider the following key principles when reconsidering how identities work in the metaverse so that we don’t end up with a dystopia:</p>



<ol><li><strong>I want to control the flow of information rather than simply mark it as public or private</strong>: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=8862" target="_blank">Contextual Integrity</a> argues that the difference between “public” and “private” information hides the real issue, which is how information flows and where it is used.</li><li><strong>I want to take time to make sure my profile is right</strong>: Many development teams worry about adding friction to the signup process; they want to get new users hooked as soon as possible. But it’s also important to make sure that new users get their profile right. It’s not an inherently bad idea to slow down the creation and curation of a profile, especially if it is one the user will be associated with&nbsp; for a long time. Teams that worry about friction have never seen someone spend an hour tweaking their character&#8217;s appearance in a video game.</li><li><strong>I want to experiment with new identities rather than commit up front: </strong>When someone starts out with a new service, they don’t know how they want to represent themselves. They might want to start with a blank avatar. On the other hand, the metaverse is so visually immersive that people who have been there for a while will have impressive avatars, and new people will stick out.</li><li><strong>I’m in control of the way my profiles interact</strong>: When I don&#8217;t want profiles not to overlap, there is usually a good reason. Services that assume we want everything to go through the same identity are making a mistake.&nbsp; We should trust that the user is making a good choice.</li><li><strong>I can use language I understand to control my identities</strong>: Creating names is creating meanings. If I want to use something simple like “my school friends,” rather than a specific school name, I should be able to do so. That freedom of choice allows the user to supply the name’s meaning, rather than having it imposed from the outside.</li><li><strong>I don’t want shadow profiles created about me</strong>: A service violates my expectations of privacy when it links together various identities. Advertising platforms are already doing this through <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/privacy-security/this-is-your-digital-fingerprint/" target="_blank">browser fingerprinting</a>. It gets even worse when you start to use biometric and behavioral data, as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNgXKX8IwcU" target="_blank">Kent Bye from the Voices of VR podcast has warned</a>. Unfortunately, users may never have control over these linkages; it may require regulation to correct. </li><li><strong>I should be warned when there are effects I might not understand due to multiple layers interacting:</strong> I should get real examples from my context to help me understand these interactions. It is the service developer’s job to help users avoid mistakes.</li></ol>



<p>Social media sites like Facebook have tried to address some of these principles. For example, Facebook’s access controls for posts allow for “public,” “friends,” “friends except…,” “specific friends,” “only me,” and “custom.” These settings are further modified by the Facebook profile privacy control settings. It often (perhaps usually) isn’t clear what is actually happening and why, nor is it clear who will or won’t be able to see a post. This confusion is a recipe for violating social norms and privacy expectations.</p>



<p>Next, how do we allow for interaction? This isn’t as simple as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%2B#Circles" target="_blank">creating circles of friends (an approach that Google+ tried</a>). How do we visualize the various identities we currently have? More user research needs to go into how people would understand these constructions of identity on a web or virtual experience. My hunch is that they need to align some identities together (like family and PTA), and to separate out others (like gamertags). I don’t think requiring users to maintain a large set of access control lists (ACLs) is the right way to control interaction between identities.</p>



<h3>The life of my identity</h3>



<p>Finally, identities have life cycles. Some exist for a long time once established, like my family, but others may be short lived.&nbsp;I might try out participation in a community, and then find it isn’t for me. There are five key steps in the lifecycle of an identity:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Create a new identity</strong> &#8211; this happens when I log into a new service or world. The new identity will need to be aligned with or separated from other identities.</li><li><strong>Share some piece of information with an identity</strong> &#8211; every meaningful identity is attached to data: common profile photos, purchased clothing, facial characteristics, voices, etc.</li><li><strong>Recover after being compromised</strong> &#8211; “oops I was hacked” will happen. What do people need to do to clean this up?</li><li><strong>Losing and recovering</strong> &#8211; if I lose the key to access this identity, is there a way I can get it back?</li><li><strong>Delete or close an identity, for now</strong> &#8211; people walk away from groups all the time. Usually they will just drift off or ghost; there should be a better way.</li></ol>



<p>All services that plan on operating in the metaverse will need to consider these different stages. If you don’t, you will create systems that fail in ways that expose people to harm.</p>



<h3>Allow for the multiplicity of a person in the metaverse</h3>



<p>If you don’t think about the requirements of people, their identities, and the lifecycle of new identities, you will build services that don’t match your users’ expectations, in particular, their expectations of privacy.</p>



<p>Identity in the metaverse is more than a costume that you put on. It will consist of all the identities, pseudo-identities, and pseudo-anonymous identities we take on today, but displayed in a way that can fool us. We can’t forget that we are humans experiencing a reality that speaks to the many facets we have inside ourselves.</p>



<p>If all of us don’t take action, a real dystopia will be created that keeps people from being who they really are. As you grow and change, you will be weighed down by who you might have been at one point or who some corporation assumed you were. You can do better by building metaverse systems that embrace the multiple identities people have in real life.</p>



<p>If you lose your identity in your metaverse, you lose yourself for real.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you live in a household with a communal device like an Amazon Echo or Google Home Hub, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/10/adobe-analytics-what-people-use-amazon-echo-and-smart-speakers-for.html" target="_blank">you probably use it to play music</a>. If you live with other people, you may find that over time, the Spotify or Pandora algorithm seems not to know you as well. You’ll find songs creeping into your playlists that you would never have chosen for yourself.&nbsp; The cause is often obvious: I’d see a whole playlist devoted to Disney musicals or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2Q5E2H5SnGG0rFgyVSsybz?si=tDd27dc_TBijj6krfGE54g" target="_blank">Minecraft fan songs</a>. I don’t listen to this music, but my children do, using the shared device in the kitchen. And that shared device only knows about a single user, and that user happens to be me.</p>



<p>More recently, many people who had end-of-year wrap up playlists created by Spotify found that they didn’t quite fit, including myself:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Picture1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14337" srcset="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Picture1.png 800w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Picture1-250x300.png 250w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Picture1-768x922.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption><br>Source: <a href="https://twitter.com/chrizbot/status/1466436036771389463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">https://twitter.com/chrizbot/status/1466436036771389463</a> </figcaption></figure>



<p>This kind of a mismatch and narrowing to one person is an identity issue that I’ve identified in previous articles about <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/communal-computing/" target="_blank">communal computing</a>.&nbsp; Most home computing devices don’t understand all of the identities (and pseudo-identities) of the people who are using the devices. The services then extend the behavior collected through these shared experiences to recommend music for personal use. In short, these devices are communal devices: they’re designed to be used by groups of people, and aren’t dedicated to an individual. But they are still based on a single-user model, in which the device is associated with (and collects data about) a single identity.</p>



<p>These services should be able to do a better job of recommending content for groups of people. Platforms like Netflix and Spotify have tried to deal with this problem, but it is difficult. I’d like to take you through some of the basics for group recommendation services, what is being tried today, and where we should go in the future.</p>



<h3>Common group recommendation methods</h3>



<p>After seeing these problems with communal identities, I became curious about how other people have solved group recommendation services so far. Recommendation services for individuals succeed if they lead to further engagement. Engagement may take different forms, based on the service type:</p>



<ul><li>Video recommendations &#8211; watching an entire show or movie, subscribing to the channel, watching the next episode</li><li>Commerce recommendations &#8211; buying the item, rating it</li><li>Music recommendations &#8211; listening to a song fully, adding to a playlist, liking</li></ul>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system#Collaborative_filtering" target="_blank">Collaborative filtering</a> (deep dive in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-collective-intelligence/9780596529321/" target="_blank">Programming Collective Intelligence</a>) is the most common approach for doing individual recommendations. It looks at who I overlap with in taste and then recommends items that I might not have tried from other people’s lists. This won’t work for group recommendations because in a group, you can’t tell which behavior (e.g., listening or liking a song) should be attributed to which person. Collaborative filtering only works when the behaviors can all be attributed to a single person.</p>



<p>Group recommendation services build on top of these individualized concepts. The most common approach is to look at each individual&#8217;s preferences and combine them in some way for the group. Two key papers discussing how to combine individual preferences describe <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/PolyLens%3A-A-recommender-system-for-groups-of-user-O'Connor-Cosley/329bad889076e8e193925cca0f20b81eefd01d16" target="_blank">PolyLens</a>, a movie recommendation service for groups, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.aaai.org/Papers/FLAIRS/2006/Flairs06-015.pdf" target="_blank">CATS</a>, an approach to collaborative filtering for group recommendations. A paper on ResearchGate <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228832829_Recommendation_to_Groups" target="_blank">summarized research on group recommendations back in 2007</a>.</p>



<p>According to the PolyLens paper, group recommendation services should “create a ‘pseudo-user’ that represents the group’s tastes, and to produce recommendations for the pseudo-user.” There could be issues about imbalances of data if some members of the group provide more behavior or preference information than others. You don’t want the group’s preferences to be dominated by a very active minority.</p>



<p>An alternative to this, again from the PolyLens paper, is to “generate recommendation lists for each group member and merge the lists.” It’s easier for these services to explain why any item is on the list, because it’s possible to show how many members of the group liked a particular item that was recommended. Creating a single pseudo-user for the group might obscure the preferences of individual members.</p>



<p>The criteria for the success of a group recommendation service are similar to the criteria for the success of individual recommendation services: are songs and movies played in their entirety? Are they added to playlists? However, group recommendations must also take into account group dynamics. Is the algorithm fair to all members of the group, or do a few members dominate its recommendations? Do its recommendations cause “misery” to some group members (i.e., are there some recommendations that most members always listen to and like, but that some always skip and strongly dislike)?</p>



<p>There are some important questions left for implementers:</p>



<ol><li>How do people join a group?</li><li>Should each individual’s history be private? </li><li>How do issues like privacy impact explainability?</li><li>Is the current use to discover something new or to revisit something that people have liked previously (e.g. find out about a new movie that no one has watched or rewatch a movie the whole family has seen together since it is easy)?</li></ol>



<p>So far, there is a lot left to understand about group recommendation services. Let’s talk about a few key cases for Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon first.</p>



<h3>Netflix avoiding the issue with profiles, or is it?</h3>



<p>Back when Netflix was primarily a DVD service (2004), they launched profiles to allow different people in the same household to have different queues of DVDs in the same account. Netflix eventually extended this practice to online streaming. In 2014, they launched <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/netflix-launches-new-way-to-promote-originals-your-profile-icon-1202883847/" target="_blank">profiles on their streaming service</a>, which asked the question “who’s watching?” on the launch screen. While multiple queues for DVDs and streaming profiles try to address similar problems they don’t end up solving group recommendations. In particular, streaming profiles per person leads to two key problems:</p>



<ul><li>When a group wants to watch a movie together, one of the group’s profiles needs to be selected. If there are children present, a kids’ profile will probably be selected.&nbsp; However, that profile doesn’t take into account the preferences of adults who are present.</li><li>When someone is visiting the house, say a guest or a babysitter, they will most likely end up choosing a random profile. This means that the visitor’s behavioral data will be added to some household member’s profile, which could skew their recommendations.</li></ul>



<p>How could Netflix provide better selection and recommendation streams when there are multiple people watching together? Netflix talked about this question in a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://netflixtechblog.com/netflix-recommendations-beyond-the-5-stars-part-1-55838468f429" target="_blank">blog post from 2012</a>, but it isn’t clear to customers what they are doing:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>That is why when you see your Top10, you are likely to discover items for dad, mom, the kids, or the whole family. Even for a single person household we want to appeal to your range of interests and moods. To achieve this, in many parts of our system we are not only optimizing for accuracy, but also for <strong>diversity</strong>.</p></blockquote>



<p>Netflix was early to consider the various people using their services in a household, but they have to go further before meeting the requirements of communal use. If diversity is rewarded, how do they know it is working for everyone “in the room” even though they don’t collect that data? As you expand who might be watching, how would they know when a show or movie is inappropriate for the audience?</p>



<h3>Amazon merges everyone into the main account</h3>



<p>When people live together in a household, it is common for one person to arrange most of the repairs or purchases. When using Amazon, that person will effectively get recommendations for the entire household. Amazon focuses on increasing the number of purchases made by that person, without understanding anything about the larger group. They will offer subscriptions to items that might be consumed by a whole household, but mistaking those for the purchases of an individual.</p>



<p>The result is that the person who wanted the item will never see additional recommendations they may have liked if they aren’t the main account holder–and the main account holder might ignore those recommendations because they don’t care. I wonder if Amazon changes recommendations to individual accounts that are part of the same Prime membership; this might address some of this mismatch.</p>



<p>The way that Amazon ties these accounts together is still subject to key questions that will help create the right recommendations for a household. How might Amazon understand that purchases such as food and other perishables are for the household, rather than an individual? What about purchases that are gifts for others in the household?</p>



<h3>Spotify is leading the charge with group playlists</h3>



<p>Spotify has created group subscription packages called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.spotify.com/us/duo/" target="_blank">Duo</a> (for couples) and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.spotify.com/us/family/" target="_blank">Premium Family</a> (for more than two people). These packages not only simplify the billing relationship with Spotify; they also provide playlists that consider everyone in the subscription.</p>



<p>The shared playlist is the union of the accounts on the same subscription. This creates a playlist of up to 50 songs that all accounts can see and play. There are some controls that allow account owners to flag songs that might not be appropriate for everyone on the subscription. Spotify provides a lot of information about how they construct the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/blend/" target="_blank">Blend playlist</a> in a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2021/12/a-look-behind-blend-the-personalized-playlist-for-youand-you/" target="_blank">recent blog post</a>. In particular, they weighed whether they should try to reduce misery or maximize joy:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Minimize the misery” is valuing democratic and coherent attributes over relevance. “Maximize the joy” values relevance over democratic and coherent attributes. Our solution is more about maximizing the joy, where we try to select the songs that are most personally relevant to a user. This decision was made based on feedback from employees and our data curation team.</p></blockquote>



<p>Reducing misery would most likely provide better background music (music that is not unpleasant to everyone in the group), but is less likely to help people discover new music from each other.</p>



<p>Spotify was also concerned about explainability: they thought people would want to know why a song was included in a blended playlist. They solved this problem, at least partly, by showing the picture of the person from whose playlists the song came.</p>



<p>These multi-person subscriptions and group playlists solve some problems, but they still struggle to answer certain questions we should ask about group recommendation services. What happens if two people have very little overlapping interest? How do we detect when someone hates certain music but is just OK with others? How do they discover new music together?</p>



<h3>Reconsidering the communal experience based on norms</h3>



<p>Most of the research into group recommendation services has been tweaking how people implicitly and explicitly rate items to be combined into a shared feed. These methods haven’t considered how people might self-select into a household or join a community that wants to have group recommendations.</p>



<p>For example, deciding what to watch on a TV may take a few steps:</p>



<ol><li>Who is in the room? Only adults or kids too? If there are kids present, there should be restrictions based on age.</li><li>What time of day is it? Are we taking a midday break or relaxing after a hard day? We may opt for educational shows for kids during the day and comedy for adults at night.</li><li>Did we just watch something from which an algorithm can infer what we want to watch next? This will lead to the next episode in a series.</li><li>Who hasn’t gotten a turn to watch something yet? Is there anyone in the household whose highest-rated songs haven’t been played? This will lead to turn taking.</li><li>And more…</li></ol>



<p>As you can see, there are contexts, norms, and history are all tied up in the way people decide what to watch next as a group. PolyLens discussed this in their paper, but didn’t act on it:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The social value functions for group recommendations can vary substantially. Group happiness may be the average happiness of the members, the happiness of the most happy member, or the happiness of the least happy member (i.e., we’re all miserable if one of us is unhappy). Other factors can be included. A social value function could weigh the opinion of expert members more highly, or could strive for long-term fairness by giving greater weight to people who “lost out” in previous recommendations.</p></blockquote>



<p>Getting this highly contextual information is very hard. It may not be possible to collect much more than “who is watching” as Netflix does today. If that is the case, we may want to reverse all of the context to the location and time. The TV room at night will have a different behavioral history than the kitchen on a Sunday morning.</p>



<p>One way to consider the success of a group recommendation service is how much browsing is required before a decision is made? If we can get someone watching or listening to something with less negotiation, that could mean the group recommendation service is doing its job.</p>



<p>With the proliferation of personal devices, people can be present to “watch” with everyone else but not be actively viewing. They could be playing a game, messaging with someone else, or simply watching something else on their device. This flexibility raises the question of what “watching together” means, but also lowers the concern that we need to get group recommendations right all the time.&nbsp; It’s easy enough for someone to do something else. However, the reverse isn’t true.&nbsp; The biggest mistake we can make is to take highly contextual behavior gathered from a shared environment and apply it to my personal recommendations.</p>



<h3>Contextual integrity and privacy of my behavior</h3>



<p>When we start mixing information from multiple people in a group, it’s possible that some will feel that their privacy has been violated. Using some of the framework of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_integrity" target="_blank">Contextual Integrity</a>, we need to look at the norms that people expect. Some people might be embarrassed if the music they enjoy privately was suddenly shown to everyone in a group or household. Is it OK to share explicit music with the household even if everyone is OK with explicit music in general?</p>



<p>People already build very complex mental models about how services like Spotify work and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053951720923377" target="_blank">sometimes personify them as &#8220;folk theories.&#8221;</a> The expectations will most likely change if group recommendation services are brought front and center. Services like Spotify will appear to be more like a social network if they don’t bury who is currently logged into a small profile picture in the corner;&nbsp; they should show everyone who is being considered for the group recommendations at that moment.</p>



<p>Privacy laws and regulations are becoming more patchwork not only worldwide (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/algorithms/" target="_blank">China has recently created regulation of content recommendation services</a>) but even within <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://builtin.com/big-data/us-data-privacy-laws" target="_blank">states of the US</a>. Collecting any data without appropriate disclosure and permission may be problematic. The fuel of recommendation services, including group recommendation services, is behavioral data about people that will fall under these laws and regulations. You should be considering what is best for the household over what is best for your organization.</p>



<h3>The dream of the whole family </h3>



<p>Today there are various efforts for improving recommendations to people living in households.&nbsp; These efforts miss the mark by not considering all of the people who could be watching, listening, or consuming the goods. This means that people do not get what they really want, and that companies get less engagement or sales than they would like.</p>



<p>The key to fixing these issues is to do a better job of understanding who is in the room, rather than making assumptions that reduce all the group members down to a single account. To do so will require user experience changes that bring the household community front and center.</p>



<p>If you are considering how you build these services, start with the expectations of the people in the environment, rather than forcing the single user model on people. When you do, you will provide something great for everyone who is in the room: a way to enjoy something together.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There’s been a lot of talk about Web3 lately, and as the person who <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.oreilly.com/pub/a/web2/archive/what-is-web-20.html" target="_blank">defined “Web 2.0”</a> 17 years ago, I’m often asked to comment. I’ve generally avoided doing so because most prognostications about the future turn out to be wrong. What we can do, though, is to ask ourselves questions that help us see more deeply into the present, the soil in which the future is rooted. As William Gibson famously said, “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/01/24/future-has-arrived/#:~:text=The%20Future%20Has%20Arrived%20%E2%80%94%20It's,Evenly%20Distributed%20Yet%20%E2%80%93%20Quote%20Investigator" target="_blank">The future is already here. It’s just not evenly distributed yet</a>.” We can also look at economic and social patterns and cycles, using as a lens <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/01/12/history-rhymes/" target="_blank">the observation ascribed to Mark Twain</a> that “history doesn’t repeat itself, but it rhymes.”</p>



<p>Using those filters, what can we say about Web3?</p>



<h2>Decentralization versus centralization</h2>



<p>The term <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/23/technology/23iht-web.html" target="_blank">Web 3.0 was used in 2006 by Tim Berners-Lee</a>, the creator of the World Wide Web, as a look forward to the next stage of the web beyond Web 2.0. He thought that the “Semantic Web” was going to be central to that evolution. It didn&#8217;t turn out that way. Now people make the case that the next generation of the web will be based on crypto.</p>



<p>“Web3” as we think of it today was introduced in 2014 by Gavin Wood, one of the cocreators of Ethereum. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/web3-gavin-wood-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Wood’s compact definition of Web3</a>, as he put it in a recent <em>Wired</em> interview, is simple: “Less trust, more truth.”</p>



<p>In making this assertion, Wood was contrasting Web3 with the original internet protocol, whose ethos was perhaps best summed up by Jon Postel’s “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc761#section-2.10" target="_blank">robustness principle</a>”: “TCP implementations should follow a general principle of robustness: be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others.” This ethos became the foundation of a global decentralized computer network&nbsp;in which no one need be in charge as long as everyone did their best to follow the same protocols and was tolerant of deviations. This system rapidly outcompeted all proprietary networks and changed the world. Unfortunately, time proved that the creators of this system were too idealistic, <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2011/8/114933-the-robustness-principle-reconsidered/fulltext?mobile=false">failing to take into account bad actors</a> and, perhaps more importantly, failing to anticipate the enormous centralization of power that would be made possible by big data, even on top of a decentralized network.</p>



<p>Wood’s point is that the blockchain replaces trust in the good intentions of others with transparency and irrevocability built into the technology. As <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ethereum/#what-is-ethereum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">explained on Ethereum.org</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Cryptographic mechanisms ensure that once transactions are verified as valid and added to the blockchain, they can&#8217;t be tampered with later. The same mechanisms also ensure that all transactions are signed and executed with appropriate &#8220;permissions&#8221; (no one should be able to send digital assets from Alice&#8217;s account, except for Alice herself).</p></blockquote>



<p>Ethereum.org’s documentation <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/web2-vs-web3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">continues</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Web2 refers to the version of the internet most of us know today. An internet dominated by companies that provide services in exchange for your personal data. Web3, in the context of Ethereum, refers to decentralized apps that run on the blockchain. These are apps that allow anyone to participate without monetising their personal data.</p></blockquote>



<p>Crypto enthusiast <a href="https://mirror.xyz/0x26163318B9972E41A734602Fe00A5683D233613f/6TFol00n6eOMP11Tupsj6Hr4WGWbW7898yWmaR8yarE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Sal Delle Palme puts it even more boldly</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We&#8217;re witnessing the birth of a new economic system. Its features and tenets are just now being devised and refined in transparent ways by millions of people around the world. Everyone is welcome to participate.</p></blockquote>



<p>I love the idealism of the Web3 vision, but we’ve been there before. During my career, we have gone through several cycles of decentralization and recentralization. The personal computer decentralized computing by providing a commodity PC architecture that anyone could build and that no one controlled. But Microsoft figured out how to recentralize the industry around a proprietary operating system. Open source software, the internet, and the World Wide Web broke the stranglehold of proprietary software with free software and open protocols, but within a few decades, Google, Amazon, and others had built huge new monopolies founded on big data.</p>



<p>Clayton Christensen generalized this pattern as <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/pub/a/tim/articles/paradigmshift_0504.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">the law of conservation of attractive profits</a>: “When attractive profits disappear at one stage in the value chain because a product becomes modular and commoditized, the opportunity to earn attractive profits with proprietary products will usually emerge at an adjacent stage.” </p>



<p>Blockchain developers believe that this time they’ve found a structural answer to recentralization, but I tend to doubt it. An interesting question to ask is what the next locus for centralization and control might be. The rapid consolidation of bitcoin mining into a small number of hands by way of lower energy costs for computation indicates one kind of recentralization. There will be others.</p>



<h2>The hype cycle</h2>



<p>The Ethereum community’s early writings on the topic offer measured assessments of the trade-offs and challenges ahead for Web3, but most popular accounts today are suffused with hype and the glamor of financial speculation. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/29/us/politics/crypto-currency-venture-capitalists.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">A recent <em>New York Times</em> article</a> provides a case in point:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Venture capitalists are betting billions of dollars to create what in effect is an alternative world of finance, commerce, communications and entertainment on the web that could radically transform major elements of the global economy—all built on the blockchain technology popularized by Bitcoin.</p></blockquote>



<p>There follows a litany of investments from crypto backer Andreessen Horowitz in areas from gaming to decentralized finance to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token" target="_blank">NFTs</a> to decentralized social networks. None of the examples in the article focus on the utility of what is being created, just the possibility that they will make their investors and creators rich. </p>



<p>And it’s not just mainstream media that’s doing breathless reporting about the money to be made as if the creation of actual value were irrelevant. Stories from those who’ve gone down the “<a href="https://mirror.xyz/0x26163318B9972E41A734602Fe00A5683D233613f/6TFol00n6eOMP11Tupsj6Hr4WGWbW7898yWmaR8yarE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">crypto rabbit hole</a>” are eloquent on the subject of access to riches:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>One of the great things about crypto is how it democratizes access to investments. For example, people already have easy access to 95 vetted crypto assets through Kraken. If you’re tech savvy enough, you could invest directly in over 1,150 crypto assets worldwide, each with market capitalizations above $10 million (at time of writing)&#8230;.</p><p>In order to gain access to early stage startup investment deals in tech, you&#8217;ve traditionally been required to be accredited and connected in Silicon Valley. In theory, the only true barrier to entry in crypto should be awareness….</p></blockquote>



<p>Repeat after me: neither venture capital investment nor easy access to risky, highly inflated assets predicts lasting success and impact for a particular company or technology. Remember the dot-com boom and the subsequent bust? Legendary investor <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2021/12/03/berkshires-munger-says-now-even-crazier-than-dot-com-bust/?slreturn=20211106151609" target="_blank">Charlie Munger of Berkshire Hathaway recently noted</a> that we’re in an “even crazier era than the dot-com era.” </p>



<p>Cryptocurrencies may well be the future of finance, but at the moment it’s hard to see what’s really working, given how much smoke is being blown. Yes, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/COIN/financials/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAI6rNDF_tlSWSdABt9Y_YdiTozbIPYSWYRTXkqC9MNibTIaYHcOshiCNSqgYO_KYaks1DwNrgqjEfW0tlup6onVSEb4vxxgVtzG4cyt2uP-LgQ14NK8uCJhD7iOLBPfX5CWH3H7ZjXg5EEtHugajpGguvqRal4-rljjNwu-0G2TD" target="_blank">exchanges like Coinbase are making a lot of money</a>, but unlike traditional financial exchanges, what’s being traded isn’t general-purpose money but a speculative asset class that may be wildly overvalued. Nor has blockchain replaced trust in the way that Gavin Wood hoped. Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/binance-probed-by-u-s-as-money-laundering-tax-sleuths-bore-in" target="_blank">under investigation for tax fraud and money laundering</a>. One recent headline points out that “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-06/small-group-is-reaping-most-of-the-gains-on-nfts-study-shows?cmpid=BBD120621_BIZ&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=211206&amp;utm_campaign=bloombergdaily" target="_blank">[a] small group of insiders is reaping most of the gains on NFTs</a>.” The interface between crypto and existing financial systems is ripe for abuse.</p>



<p>If Web3 is to become a general purpose financial system, or a general system for decentralized trust, it needs to develop robust interfaces with the real world, its legal systems, and the operating economy. <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/constitutiondao-the-need-for-trust-memes-and-reality/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJlbnQiOnsidXJpIjpbImh0dHBzOi8vc3RyYXRlY2hlcnkuY29tLzIwMjEvY29uc3RpdHV0aW9uZGFvLXRoZS1uZWVkLWZvci10cnVzdC1tZW1lcy1hbmQtcmVhbGl0eS8iXX0sImV4cCI6MTYzOTY2MTE2NCwiaWF0IjoxNjM3MDY5MTY0LCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZS9vYXV0aCIsInNjb3BlIjoiYXJ0aWNsZTpyZWFkIGNhdGVnb3J5OnJlYWQiLCJzdWIiOiJqRHF1MmJWU3BwSkp4eUxxcmJQNnUiLCJ1c2UiOiJhY2Nlc3MifQ.Y2H-oz504XqCdoPkrsL6B6ynRXAtKaSEj-VNKATkXufgNXxtenTXhlonmnHTnBohAZmbtD-fTjrIOhSxtwbMyjJn8sBrZyl4OwiJRH_JGWuhaVEXuBMCLtPAAuKPg-j2TAakzbS2-KkMN1rtV7H99RBCe0N_N2gSI0HhwkRaXuoi32YC3HLFZICjGDTnb4qvVDrD_g4E2dsjtPNjlWTVt0QU1xyyuGO5iGrsMU3kkbJieo8Sh7WM9DsN7ob7T13Vag-fUa3sJVPyTHVtJQ_APwIDhHUJjwttVA_u2MFm_V4t5jcT4btJTjp-Dv1K0uNsoIZ-k-ln-gcT4d6K0cPeTQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">The story of ConstitutionDAO</a> illustrates how difficult it is to build bridges between the self-referential world of crypto assets being bought with cryptocurrencies and a working economic system where the Web3 economy is linked to actual ownership or the utility of non-Web 3 assets. If the DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) had succeeded in buying a rare copy of the US constitution at auction, its members wouldn’t have had a legal ownership stake in the actual object or even clear governance rights as to what might happen with it. It would have been owned by an LLC set up by the people who started the project. And when the DAO failed to win the bid, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22800995/constitutiondao-refund-progress-steep-gas-fees-cryptocurrency" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">the LLC has had trouble even refunding the money to its backers</a>.</p>



<p>The failure to think through and build interfaces to existing legal and commercial mechanisms is in stark contrast to previous generations of the web, which quickly became a digital shadow of everything in the physical world—people, objects, locations, businesses—with interconnections that made it easy to create economically valuable new services in the existing economy. The easy money to be made speculating on crypto assets seems to have distracted developers and investors from the hard work of building useful real-world services.</p>



<p>This isn’t to say there aren’t real opportunities for Web3 beyond financial speculation.&nbsp; Crypto is well-suited for digital-only assets that can be valued and used in a self-contained world, like a computer game or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/a-second-life-for-crypto-and-nfts-in-the-metaverse-another-meta-exec-quits?rc=7em78a&amp;shared=ba5b1dd83daf5a4c" target="_blank">the longed-for metaverse</a>.

<p>Of course, crypto and Web3 are only a tiny fraction of today’s speculative excess. Valuations of the startup du jour are also sky-high, and it’s not at all clear that the valuations are accurate measures of actual value being created. They may well just be a con game that benefits a small number of insiders, much like the financial instruments that made so many Wall Streeters rich before nearly crashing the world economy in 2009. So, as Matt Stoller wrote recently, “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/cryptocurrencies-a-necessary-scam?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMjU2Mzk2LCJwb3N0X2lkIjo0NTAzNTY1NywiXyI6InNzTUVnIiwiaWF0IjoxNjM5MTU3NDA3LCJleHAiOjE2MzkxNjEwMDcsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0xMTUyNCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.yYlGoiSkciF_NeFFJOTG0-HyAQsT0x_TcZmssBu6rwU" target="_blank">Web3 is a bunch of bullshit. The problem is, compared to what?</a>” The current economic system is rife with fraud, and is also rigged in favor of insiders! Web3 dreamers like those behind the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://celo.org/" target="_blank">Celo project</a> are right. We do need a new economic system.</p>



<h2>Two kinds of bubble</h2>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">The Dutch tulip mania</a> from 1634 to 1637 is the classic example of a wild difference between the nominal financial value of an asset class and its intrinsic value. When the bubble popped, tulips went back to being flowers, beautiful but no longer worth a fortune, with no lasting impact on the prosperous Dutch economy. There have been many speculative bubbles since, and most of them have faded into the background noise of history.</p>



<p>There is another kind of bubble, though, identified by economist Carlota Perez in her book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Technological-Revolutions-Financial-Capital-Dynamics/dp/1843763311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"><em>Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital</em></a>. She notes that virtually every past major industrial transformation—the first Industrial Revolution; the age of steam power; the age of steel, electricity, and heavy machinery; the age of automobiles, oil, and mass production; and the internet—was accompanied by a financial bubble.</p>



<p>Perez identifies four stages in each of these 50–60-year innovation cycles. In the first stage, there’s foundational investment in new technology. This gives way to speculative frenzy in which financial capital seeks continued outsized returns in a rapidly evolving market that is beginning to consolidate. After the speculative bubble pops, there’s a period of more-sustained consolidation and market correction (including regulation of excess market power), followed by a mature “golden age” of integration of the new technology into society. Eventually, the technology is sufficiently mature that capital moves elsewhere, funding the next nascent technology revolution, and the cycle repeats.</p>



<p>An important conclusion of Perez’s analysis is that a true technology revolution must be accompanied by the development of substantial new infrastructure. For the first Industrial Revolution, this included canal and road networks; for the second, railways, ports, and postal services; for the third, electrical, water, and distribution networks; for the oil age, interstate highways, airports, refining and distribution capacity, and hotels and motels; for the information age, chip fabs, ubiquitous telecommunications, and data centers.</p>



<p>Much of this infrastructure build-out is funded during the bubble phase. As Perez puts it:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>What is perhaps the crucial role of the financial bubble is to facilitate the unavoidable over-investment in the new infrastructures. The nature of these networks is such that they cannot provide enough service to be profitable unless they reach enough coverage for widespread usage. The bubble provides the necessary asset inflation for investors to expect capital gains, even if there are no profits or dividends yet.</p></blockquote>



<p>And so, there was a canal bubble, a railroad bubble, and, of course, the dot-com bubble, which ended just as Perez was finishing her book. A frenzy of inefficient investment had left behind dark fiber, empty data centers, and a whole lot of talent and know-how that was ready to be reused during the consolidation phase.</p>



<p>In Perez’s narrative, many smaller technology cycles are rolled into one. Consider the history of modern digital computing. It has had several phases, each dominated by a new generation of technology: the mainframe, the PC, the internet and the World Wide Web, the smartphone, and now, perhaps, cryptocurrencies and the metaverse. Each of these has had its own cycle of innovation, speculation, bust, and maturity.</p>



<p>So is what we’re calling Web3 the foundational investment period of a new subcycle, or the bubble period of the preceding one? It seems to me that one way to tell is the nature of the investment. Is abundant financial capital building out useful infrastructure in the way that we saw for the previous cycles? </p>



<p>It’s not clear to me that NFTs fit the bill. There’s no question, though, that the disruption of finance—in the same way that the internet has already disrupted media and commerce—would represent an essential next stage in the current cycle of technological revolution. In particular, if it were possible for capital to be allocated effectively without the trust and authority of large centralized capital providers (“Wall Street&#8221; so to speak), that would be a foundational advance. In that regard, what I’d be looking for is evidence of capital allocation via cryptocurrencies toward productive investment in the operating economy rather than capital allocation toward imaginary assets. <a href="http://twitter.com/timoreilly">Let me know</a> of any good instances that you hear about.</p>



<p>To make clearer what I’m talking about, let me take an aside from crypto and Web3 to look at another technology revolution: the green energy revolution. There, it is completely obvious that bubble valuations are already financing the development of lasting infrastructure. Elon Musk has been a master at taking the outsized speculative price of Tesla stock (which at one point a year or two ago was valued at 1,500 years of the company’s profits!) and turning it into a nationwide electric vehicle charging grid, battery gigafactories, and autonomous vehicle capabilities, all the while catalyzing entire industries to chase him into the future. So too has Jeff Bezos used Amazon’s outsized valuation to build a new infrastructure of just-in-time commerce. And both of them are investing in the infrastructure of the commercial space industry.</p>



<p>In assessing the progress toward Web3 as advertised, I’d also compare the adoption of cryptocurrency for other functions of financial systems—purchasing, remittances, and so on—not only with traditional banking networks but also with other emerging technologies. For example, are Ripple and Stellar more successful platforms for cross-border remittances than bank transfers, credit cards, or PayPal, in the same way that Google Maps was better than Rand McNally or first-generation GPS pioneers like Garmin? There’s some evidence that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2021/new-study-crypto-emerging-as-favored-form-for-cross-border-remittances/" target="_blank">crypto is becoming a meaningful player in this market</a>, though <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-16/ripple-wants-to-limit-sec-sway-over-crypto-as-legal-fight-rages" target="_blank">regulatory hurdles are slowing adoption</a>. Never mind remittances, though—what about payments more generally? How does growth compare with that of a non-crypto payment startup like <a href="https://www.meliopayments.com/">Melio</a>, which is focused on building against small business use cases? Given the interest in crypto from companies like Square (now Block) and Stripe, they are well positioned to tell us of progress for crypto relative to more traditional payment mechanisms.</p>



<p>Similarly, if Web3 is going to be the future of identity, or of social media, we need to ask ourselves what evidence is there of adoption—is it really a better mousetrap in the way that previous generations of internet technology proved to be? I fault the reporting on the field for its almost complete lack of coverage of this kind of information.</p>



<h2>Where are we in the cycle?</h2>



<p>The question might be asked whether the current stage of Web3 is more equivalent to 1995 or 1999—the early stage of the bubble or its end? Given the current valuation of crypto assets (and tech startups in general), it’s hard to argue for the earlier date.</p>



<p>I like to remind people that I wrote “What Is Web 2.0?” five years after the dot-com bust with the explicit goal of explaining why some companies survived and others did not. So too, I suspect that it won’t be till after the next bust that we’ll really understand what, if anything, Web3 consists of.</p>



<p>From the last bubble go round, I can offer several pragmatic observations in addition to the technology and business-model changes I had tried to capture in “What Is Web 2.0?”</p>



<ol><li>All of the companies that survived were making money—a lot of it. (In the case of Amazon, it was free cash flow, not profit, but the numbers were huge, as was the business and economic insight behind it.) Their valuations, while high, were supported by plausible models of future earnings and cash flow.</li><li>None of them needed to raise enormous sums of money by today’s standards. (Yahoo’s total pre-IPO investment was <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/yahoo/company_financials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">$6.8 million</a>, Google’s <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/google/company_financials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">$36 million</a>, and Amazon’s <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/amazon/company_financials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">$108 million</a>.) When you see companies go back again and again to investors for funding without ever reaching a profit, they may not really be businesses; they may better be thought of as financial instruments.</li><li>They all had millions, then tens of millions, then hundreds of millions (and eventually billions) of daily active users for world-changing new services.</li><li>They had all built unique, substantial, and lasting assets in the form of data, infrastructure, and differentiated business models.</li><li>The companies that came to dominate the tech landscape during the next generation were not all up-and-comers. Apple and Microsoft handily made the transition to the next generation, and in the case of Apple, even led it.</li></ol>



<p>Keep in mind that it was still early when the dot-com bubble popped. Google Maps hadn’t been invented yet, nor had the iPhone and Android. Online payments were in their infancy. No Twitter or Facebook. No AWS and cloud computing. Most of what we rely on today didn’t yet exist.</p>



<p>I suspect it will be the same for crypto. So much is yet to be created. Let’s focus on the parts of the Web3 vision that aren’t about easy riches, on solving hard problems in trust, identity, and decentralized finance. And above all, let’s focus on the interface between crypto and the real world that people live in, where, as&nbsp; <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/on-what-matters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Matthew Yglesias put it</a> when talking about housing inequality, “a society becomes wealthy over time by accumulating a stock of long-lasting capital goods.” If, as Sal Delle Palme argues, Web3 heralds the birth of a new economic system, let’s make it one that increases true wealth—not just paper wealth for those lucky enough to get in early but actual life-changing goods and services that make life better for everyone.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Much has been written about struggles of deploying machine learning projects to production. As with many burgeoning fields and disciplines, we don’t yet have a shared canonical infrastructure stack or best practices for developing and deploying data-intensive applications. This is both frustrating for companies that would prefer making ML an ordinary, fuss-free value-generating function like software engineering, as well as exciting for vendors who see the opportunity to create buzz around a new category of enterprise software.</p>



<p>The new category is often called <em>MLOps</em>. While there isn’t an authoritative definition for the term, it shares its ethos with its predecessor, the <em>DevOps </em>movement in software engineering: by adopting well-defined processes, modern tooling, and automated workflows, we can streamline the process of moving from development to robust production deployments. This approach has worked well for software development, so it is reasonable to assume that it could address struggles related to deploying machine learning in production too.</p>



<p>However, the concept is quite abstract. Just introducing a new term like MLOps doesn’t solve anything by itself, rather, it just adds to the confusion. In this article, we want to dig deeper into the fundamentals of machine learning as an engineering discipline and outline answers to key questions:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Why</strong> does ML need special treatment in the first place? Can’t we just fold it into existing DevOps best practices?</li><li><strong>What</strong> does a modern technology stack for streamlined ML processes look like?</li><li><strong>How</strong> can you start applying the stack in practice today?</li></ol>



<h2>Why: Data Makes It Different</h2>



<p>All ML projects are software projects. If you peek under the hood of an ML-powered application, these days you will often find a repository of Python code. If you ask an engineer to show how they operate the application in production, they will likely show containers and operational dashboards—not unlike any other software service.</p>



<p>Since software engineers manage to build ordinary software without experiencing as much pain as their counterparts in the ML department, it begs the question: should we just start treating ML projects as software engineering projects as usual, maybe educating ML practitioners about the existing best practices?</p>



<p>Let’s start by considering the job of a non-ML software engineer: writing traditional software deals with well-defined, narrowly-scoped inputs, which the engineer can exhaustively and cleanly model in the code. In effect, the engineer designs and builds the world wherein the software operates.</p>



<p>In contrast, a defining feature of ML-powered applications is that they are directly exposed to a large amount of messy, real-world data which is too complex to be understood and modeled by hand.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/MLOps-v7_Fig1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14022" srcset="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/MLOps-v7_Fig1.png 1024w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/MLOps-v7_Fig1-300x225.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/MLOps-v7_Fig1-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>This characteristic makes ML applications fundamentally different from traditional software. It has far-reaching implications as to how such applications should be developed and by whom:</p>



<ol><li><strong>ML applications are directly exposed to the constantly changing real world through data, </strong>whereas traditional software operates in a simplified, static, abstract world which is directly constructed by the developer. </li><li><strong>ML apps need to be developed through cycles of experimentation: </strong>due to the constant exposure to data, we don’t learn the behavior of ML apps through logical reasoning but through empirical observation.</li><li><strong>The skillset and the background of people building the applications gets realigned</strong>: while it is still effective to express applications in code, the emphasis shifts to data and experimentation—more akin to empirical science—rather than traditional software engineering.</li></ol>



<p>This approach is not novel. There is a decades-long tradition of <em>data-centric programming</em>: developers who have been using data-centric IDEs, such as RStudio, Matlab, Jupyter Notebooks, or even Excel to model complex real-world phenomena, should find this paradigm familiar. However, these tools have been rather insular environments: they are great for prototyping but lacking when it comes to production use.</p>



<p>To make ML applications production-ready from the beginning, developers must adhere to the same set of standards as all other production-grade software. This introduces further requirements:</p>



<ol><li><strong>The scale of operations </strong>is often two orders of magnitude larger than in the earlier data-centric environments. Not only is data larger, but models—deep learning models in particular—are much larger than before.</li><li><strong>Modern ML applications need to be carefully orchestrated: </strong>with the dramatic increase in the complexity of apps, which can require dozens of interconnected steps, developers need better software paradigms, such as first-class DAGs.</li><li><strong>We need robust versioning for data, models, code, </strong>and preferably even the internal state of applications—think Git on steroids to answer inevitable questions: What changed? Why did something break? Who did what and when? How do two iterations compare?</li><li><strong>The applications must be integrated to the surrounding business systems </strong>so ideas can be tested and validated in the real world in a controlled manner.</li></ol>



<p>Two important trends collide in these lists. On the one hand we have the long tradition of data-centric programming; on the other hand, we face the needs of modern, large-scale business applications. Either paradigm is insufficient by itself: it would be ill-advised to suggest building a modern ML application in Excel. Similarly, it would be pointless to pretend that a data-intensive application resembles a run-off-the-mill microservice which can be built with the usual software toolchain consisting of, say, GitHub, Docker, and Kubernetes.</p>



<p>We need a new path that allows the results of data-centric programming, models and data science applications in general, to be deployed to modern production infrastructure, similar to how DevOps practices allows traditional software artifacts to be deployed to production continuously and reliably. Crucially, the new path is analogous but not equal to the existing DevOps path.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Picture2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14035" width="530" height="488" srcset="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Picture2.png 491w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Picture2-300x276.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px" /></figure>



<h2>What: The Modern Stack of ML Infrastructure</h2>



<p>What kind of foundation would the modern ML application require? It should combine the best parts of modern production infrastructure to ensure robust deployments, as well as draw inspiration from data-centric programming to maximize productivity.</p>



<p>While implementation details vary, the major infrastructural layers we’ve seen emerge are relatively uniform across a large number of projects. Let’s now take a tour of the various layers, to begin to map the territory. Along the way, we’ll provide illustrative examples. The intention behind the examples is not to be comprehensive (perhaps a fool’s errand, anyway!), but to reference concrete tooling used today in order to ground what could otherwise be a somewhat abstract exercise.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Picture3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14033" width="580" height="294" srcset="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Picture3.png 641w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Picture3-300x152.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /><figcaption><br>Adapted from the book <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/effective-data-science-infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"><em>Effective Data Science Infrastructure</em></a></figcaption></figure>



<h3>Foundational Infrastructure Layers</h3>



<h4>Data</h4>



<p><strong>Data</strong> is at the core of any ML project, so data infrastructure is a foundational concern. ML use cases rarely dictate the master data management solution, so the ML stack needs to integrate with existing data warehouses. Cloud-based data warehouses, such as <strong>Snowflake</strong>, AWS’ portfolio of databases like <strong>RDS, Redshift </strong>or <strong>Aurora</strong>, or an <strong>S3-based data lake</strong>, are a great match to ML use cases since they tend to be much more scalable than traditional databases, both in terms of the data set sizes as well as query patterns.</p>



<h4>Compute</h4>



<p>To make data useful, we must be able to conduct large-scale <strong>compute</strong> easily. Since the needs of data-intensive applications are diverse, it is useful to have a general-purpose compute layer that can handle different types of tasks from IO-heavy data processing to training large models on GPUs. Besides variety, the number of tasks can be high too: imagine a single workflow that trains a separate model for 200 countries in the world, running a hyperparameter search over 100 parameters for each model—the workflow yields 20,000 parallel tasks.</p>



<p>Prior to the cloud, setting up and operating a cluster that can handle workloads like this would have been a major technical challenge. Today, a number of cloud-based, auto-scaling systems are easily available, such as <strong>AWS Batch. Kubernetes,</strong> a popular choice for general-purpose container orchestration, can be configured to work as a scalable batch compute layer, although the downside of its flexibility is increased complexity. Note that container orchestration for the compute layer is not to be confused with the workflow orchestration layer, which we will cover next.</p>



<h4>Orchestration</h4>



<p>The nature of computation is structured: we must be able to manage the complexity of applications by structuring them, for example, as a graph or a workflow that is <strong>orchestrated</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Picture4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14029" width="534" height="134" srcset="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Picture4.png 977w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Picture4-300x75.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Picture4-768x193.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px" /></figure>



<p>The workflow orchestrator needs to perform a seemingly simple task: given a workflow or DAG definition, execute the tasks defined by the graph in order using the compute layer. There are countless systems that can perform this task for small DAGs on a single server. However, as the workflow orchestrator plays a key role in ensuring that production workflows execute reliably, it makes sense to use a system that is both scalable and highly available, which leaves us with a few battle-hardened options, for instance: <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"><strong>Airflow</strong></a>, a popular open-source workflow orchestrator; <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"><strong>Argo</strong></a><strong>, </strong>a newer orchestrator that runs natively on Kubernetes, and managed solutions such as <a href="https://cloud.google.com/composer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"><strong>Google Cloud Composer</strong></a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"><strong>AWS Step Functions</strong></a>.</p>



<h3>Software Development Layers</h3>



<p>While these three foundational layers, data, compute, and orchestration, are technically all we need to execute ML applications at arbitrary scale, building and operating ML applications directly on top of these components would be like hacking software in assembly language: technically possible but inconvenient and unproductive. To make people productive, we need higher levels of abstraction. Enter the software development layers.</p>



<h4>Versioning</h4>



<p>ML app and software artifacts exist and evolve in a dynamic environment. To manage the dynamism, we can resort to taking snapshots that represent immutable points in time: of models, of data, of code, and of internal state. For this reason, we require <strong>a strong versioning layer</strong>.</p>



<p>While <strong>Git</strong>, <strong>GitHub, </strong>and other similar tools for software version control work well for code and the usual workflows of software development, they are a bit clunky for tracking all experiments, models, and data. To plug this gap, frameworks like <a href="https://docs.metaflow.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"><strong>Metaflow</strong></a> or <a href="https://mlflow.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"><strong>MLFlow</strong></a> provide a custom solution for versioning.</p>



<h4>Software Architecture</h4>



<p>Next, we need to consider who builds these applications and how. They are often built by data scientists who are not software engineers or computer science majors by training. Arguably, high-level programming languages like Python are the most expressive and efficient ways that humankind has conceived to formally define complex processes. It is hard to imagine a better way to express non-trivial business logic and convert mathematical concepts into an executable form.</p>



<p>However, not all Python code is equal. Python written in Jupyter notebooks following the tradition of data-centric programming is very different from Python used to implement a scalable web server. To make the data scientists maximally productive, we want to provide supporting <strong>software architecture </strong>in terms of APIs and libraries that allow them to focus on data, not on the machines.</p>



<h4>Data Science Layers</h4>



<p>With these five layers, we can present a highly productive, data-centric software interface that enables iterative development of large-scale data-intensive applications. However, none of these layers help with modeling and optimization. We cannot expect data scientists to write modeling frameworks like PyTorch or optimizers like Adam from scratch! Furthermore, there are steps that are needed to go from raw data to features required by models.</p>



<h4>Model Operations</h4>



<p>When it comes to data science and modeling, we separate three concerns, starting from the most practical progressing towards the most theoretical. Assuming you have a model, how can you use it effectively? Perhaps you want to produce predictions in real-time or as a batch process. No matter what you do, you should monitor the quality of the results. Altogether, we can group these practical concerns in the <strong>model operations</strong> layer. There are many new tools in this space helping with various aspects of operations, including <a href="https://www.seldon.io/tech/products/deploy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"><strong>Seldon</strong></a> for model deployments, <a href="https://wandb.ai/site" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"><strong>Weights and Biases</strong></a> for model monitoring, and <a href="https://truera.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"><strong>TruEra</strong></a> for model explainability.</p>



<h4>Feature Engineering</h4>



<p>Before you have a model, you have to decide how to feed it with labelled data. Managing the process of converting raw facts to features is a deep topic of its own, potentially involving feature encoders, feature stores, and so on. Producing labels is another, equally deep topic. You want to carefully manage consistency of data between training and predictions, as well as make sure that there’s no leakage of information when models are being trained and tested with historical data. We bucket these questions in the <strong>feature engineering</strong> layer. There’s an emerging space of ML-focused feature stores such as <a href="https://www.tecton.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"><strong>Tecton</strong></a> or labeling solutions like <a href="https://scale.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"><strong>Scale</strong></a> and <a href="https://snorkel.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"><strong>Snorkel</strong></a>. Feature stores aim to solve the challenge that many data scientists in an organization require similar data transformations and features for their work and labeling solutions deal with <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/arguments-against-hand-labeling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">the very real challenges associated with hand labeling datasets</a>.</p>



<h4>Model Development</h4>



<p>Finally, at the very top of the stack we get to the question of mathematical modeling: What kind of modeling technique to use? What model architecture is most suitable for the task? How to parameterize the model? Fortunately, excellent off-the-shelf libraries like <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"><strong>scikit-learn</strong></a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"><strong>PyTorch</strong></a> are available to help with <strong>model development</strong>.</p>



<h3>An Overarching Concern: Correctness and Testing</h3>



<p>Regardless of the systems we use at each layer of the stack, we want to guarantee the correctness of results. In traditional software engineering we can do this by writing tests: for instance, a unit test can be used to check the behavior of a function with predetermined inputs. Since we know exactly how the function is implemented, we can convince ourselves through inductive reasoning that the function should work correctly, based on the correctness of a unit test.</p>



<p>This process doesn’t work when the function, such as a model, is opaque to us. We must resort to <em>black box testing</em>—testing the behavior of the function with a wide range of inputs. Even worse, sophisticated ML applications can take a huge number of contextual data points as inputs, like the time of day, user’s past behavior, or device type into account, so an accurate test set up may need to become a full-fledged simulator.</p>



<p>Since building an accurate simulator is a highly non-trivial challenge in itself, often it is easier to use a slice of the real-world as a simulator and A/B test the application in production against a known baseline. To make A/B testing possible, all layers of the stack should be be able to run many versions of the application concurrently, so an arbitrary number of production-like deployments can be run simultaneously. This poses a challenge to many infrastructure tools of today, which have been designed for more rigid traditional software in mind. Besides infrastructure, effective A/B testing requires a control plane, a modern experimentation platform, such as <a href="https://statsig.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">StatSig</a>.</p>



<h2>How: Wrapping The Stack For Maximum Usability</h2>



<p>Imagine choosing a production-grade solution for each layer of the stack: for instance, Snowflake for data, Kubernetes for compute (container orchestration), and Argo for workflow orchestration. While each system does a good job at its own domain, it is not trivial to build a data-intensive application that has cross-cutting concerns touching all the foundational layers. In addition, you have to layer the higher-level concerns from versioning to model development on top of the already complex stack. It is not realistic to ask a data scientist to prototype quickly and deploy to production with confidence using such a contraption. Adding more YAML to cover cracks in the stack is not an adequate solution.</p>



<p>Many data-centric environments of the previous generation, such as Excel and RStudio, really shine at maximizing usability and developer productivity. Optimally, we could wrap the production-grade infrastructure stack inside a developer-oriented user interface. Such an interface should allow the data scientist to focus on concerns that are most relevant for them, namely the topmost layers of stack, while abstracting away the foundational layers.</p>



<p>The combination of a production-grade core and a user-friendly shell makes sure that ML applications can be prototyped rapidly, deployed to production, and brought back to the prototyping environment for continuous improvement. The iteration cycles should be measured in hours or days, not in months.</p>

<p>Over the past five years, a number of such frameworks have started to emerge, both as commercial offerings as well as in open-source.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.metaflow.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Metaflow</strong></a> is an open-source framework, originally developed at Netflix, specifically designed to address this concern (disclaimer: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://outerbounds.co/" target="_blank">one of the authors works on Metaflow</a>): How can we wrap robust production infrastructure in a single coherent, easy-to-use interface for data scientists? Under the hood, Metaflow integrates with best-of-the-breed production infrastructure, such as Kubernetes and AWS Step Functions, while providing a development experience that draws inspiration from data-centric programming, that is, by treating local prototyping as the first-class citizen.</p>



<p>Google’s open-source <a href="https://www.kubeflow.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"><strong>Kubeflow</strong></a> addresses similar concerns, although with a more engineer-oriented approach. As a commercial product, <a href="https://databricks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"><strong>Databricks</strong></a> provides a managed environment that combines data-centric notebooks with a proprietary production infrastructure. All cloud providers provide commercial solutions as well, such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"><strong>AWS Sagemaker</strong></a> or <a href="https://studio.azureml.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"><strong>Azure ML Studio</strong></a>.</p>



<p>While these solutions, and many less known ones, seem similar on the surface, there are many differences between them. When evaluating solutions, consider focusing on the three key dimensions covered in this article:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Does the solution provide a delightful user experience for data scientists and ML engineers?</strong> There is no fundamental reason why data scientists should accept a worse level of productivity than is achievable with existing data-centric tools.</li><li><strong>Does the solution provide first-class support for rapid iterative development and frictionless A/B testing?</strong> It should be easy to take projects quickly from prototype to production and back, so production issues can be reproduced and debugged locally.</li><li><strong>Does the solution integrate with your existing infrastructure, in particular to the foundational data, compute, and orchestration layers?</strong> It is not productive to operate ML as an island. When it comes to operating ML in production, it is beneficial to be able to leverage existing production tooling for observability and deployments, for example, as much as possible.</li></ol>



<p>It is safe to say that all existing solutions still have room for improvement. Yet it seems inevitable that over the next five years the whole stack will mature, and the user experience will converge towards and eventually beyond the best data-centric IDEs.&nbsp; Businesses will learn how to create value with ML similar to traditional software engineering and empirical, data-driven development will take its place amongst other ubiquitous software development paradigms.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Humans have wrestled with ethics for millennia. Each generation spawns a fresh batch of ethical dilemmas and then wonders how to deal with them. </p>



<p>For this generation, social media has generated a vast set of new ethical challenges, which is unsurprising when you consider the degree of its influence. Social media has been linked to health risks in individuals and political violence in societies. Despite growing awareness of its potential for causing harm, social media has received what amounts to a free pass on unethical behavior.</p>



<p>Minerva Tantoco, who served as New York City’s first chief technology officer, suggests that “technology exceptionalism” is the root cause. Unlike the rapacious robber barons of the Gilded Age, today’s tech moguls were viewed initially as eccentric geeks who enjoyed inventing cool new products. Social media was perceived as a harmless timewaster, rather than as a carefully designed tool for relentless commerce and psychological manipulation.</p>



<p>“The idea of treating social media differently came about because the individuals who started it weren’t from traditional media companies,” Tantoco says. “Over time, however, the distinction between social media and traditional media has blurred, and perhaps the time has come for social media to be subject to the same rules and codes that apply to broadcasters, news outlets and advertisers. Which means that social media would be held accountable for content that causes harm or violates existing laws.”</p>



<p>Ethical standards that were developed for print, radio, television, and telecommunications during the 20<sup>th</sup> century could be applied to social media. “We would start with existing norms and codes for media generally and test whether these existing frameworks and laws would apply to social media,” Tantoco says.</p>



<p>Taking existing norms and applying them, with modifications, to novel situations is a time-honored practice.&nbsp; “When e-commerce web sites first started, it was unclear if state sales taxes would apply to purchases,” Tantoco says. “It turned out that online sales were not exempt from sales taxes and that rules that had been developed for mail-order sites decades earlier could be fairly applied to e-commerce.”</p>



<h2><strong>Learning from AI</strong></h2>



<p>Christine Chambers Goodman, a professor at Pepperdine University’s Caruso School of Law, has written extensively on the topic of artificial intelligence and its impact on society. She sees potential in applying AI guidelines to social media, and she cited the European Commission’s High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence’s seven key ethical requirements for trustworthy AI:<sup>1</sup></p>



<ul><li>Human agency and oversight</li><li>Technical robustness and safety</li><li>Privacy and data governance</li><li>Transparency</li><li>Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness</li><li>Societal and environmental well-being</li><li>Accountability</li></ul>



<p>The commission’s proposed requirements for AI would be a good starting point for conversations about ethical social media. Ideally, basic ethical components would be designed into social media platforms before they are built. Software engineers should be trained to recognize their own biases and learn specific techniques for writing code that is inherently fair and non-discriminatory.</p>



<p>“It starts with that first requirement of human agency and oversight,” Goodman says. If ethical standards are “paramount” during the design phase of a platform, “then I see some room for optimism.”</p>



<p>Colleges and universities also can play important roles in training a new generation of ethical software engineers by requiring students to take classes in ethics, she says.</p>



<h2><strong>Economic Fairness and Equity</strong></h2>



<p>Social media companies are private business entities, even when they are publicly held. But the social media phenomenon has become so thoroughly woven into the fabric of our daily lives that many people now regard it as a public utility such as gas, electricity, and water. In a remarkably brief span of time, social media has become an institution, and generally speaking, we expect our institutions to behave fairly and equitably.&nbsp; Clearly, however, the social media giants see no reason to share the economic benefits of their success with anyone except their shareholders.</p>



<p>“The large social media companies make hundreds of billions of dollars from advertising revenue and share almost none of it with their users,” says Greg Fell, CEO of <a href="https://www.displaysocial.com/">Display Social</a>, a platform that shares up to 50 percent of its advertising revenue with content creators who post on its site.</p>



<p>Historically, content creators have been paid for their work. Imagine if CBS had told Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz that they wouldn’t be paid for creating episodes of “I Love Lucy,” but that instead they would be allowed to sell “I Love Lucy” coffee mugs and T-shirts. If the original TV networks had operated like social media corporations, there never would have been a Golden Age of Television.</p>



<p>Most societies reward creators, artists, entertainers, athletes, and influencers for their contributions. Why does social media get to play by a different set of rules?</p>



<p>“Economic fairness should be part of the social media ethos. People should be rewarded financially for posting on social media, instead of being exploited by business models that are unfair and unethical,” Fell says.</p>



<p>From Fell’s perspective, the exploitive and unfair economic practices of the large social media companies represent short-term thinking. “Ultimately, they will burn out their audiences and implode. Meantime, they are causing harm. That’s the problem with unethical behavior—in the long run, it’s self-destructive and self-defeating.”</p>



<h2><strong>Transforming Attention into Revenue</strong></h2>



<p>Virtually all of the large social media platforms rely on some form of advertising to generate revenue. Their business models are exceedingly simple: they attract the attention of users and then sell the attention to advertisers. In crude terms, they’re selling your eyeballs to the highest bidder.</p>



<p>As a result, their only real interest is attracting attention. The more attention they attract, the more money they make. Their algorithms are brilliantly designed to catch and hold your attention by serving up content that will trigger dopamine rushes in your brain. Dopamine isn’t a cause of addiction, but it plays a role in addictive behaviors. So, is it fair to say that social media is intentionally addictive? Maybe.</p>



<p>“For many social media companies, addictive behavior (as in people consuming more than they intend to and regretting it afterwards) is the point,” says Esther Dyson, an author, philanthropist, and investor&nbsp;focused on&nbsp;health,&nbsp;open government, digital technology,&nbsp;biotechnology, and&nbsp;aerospace. “Cigarettes, drugs, and gambling are all premised on the model that too much is never enough.&nbsp; And from the point of view of many investors, sustainable profits are not enough.&nbsp; They want exits. Indeed, the goal of these investors is creating ever-growing legions of addicts. That starts with generating and keeping attention.”</p>



<h2><strong>Monetizing Misinformation</strong></h2>



<p>As it happens, misinformation is highly attractive to many users. It’s a digital version of potato chips—you can’t eat just one. The algorithms figure this out quickly, and feed users a steady supply of misinformation to hold their attention.</p>



<p>In an advertising-driven business model, attention equals dollars. With the help of machine learning and sophisticated algorithms, social media has effectively monetized misinformation, creating a vicious, addictive cycle that seems increasingly difficult to stop.</p>



<p>Social media has staked its fortunes to a business model that is deeply unethical and seems destined to fail in the long term. But could the industry survive, at least in the short term, with a business model that hews more closely to ethical norms? </p>



<p>Greg Fell doesn’t believe that ethical guidelines will slow the industry’s growth or reduce its profitability. “People expect fairness. They want to be treated as human beings, not as products,” he says. “You can build fairness into a platform if you make it part of your goal from the start. But it shouldn’t be an afterthought.”</p>



<h2><strong>Slowing the Spread of False Narratives</strong></h2>



<p>In addition to implementing structural design elements that would make it easier for people to recognize misinformation and false narratives, social media companies could partner with the public sector to promote media literacy.&nbsp; Renée DiResta is the technical research manager at&nbsp;<a href="https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/content/io-landing-page-2">Stanford Internet Observatory,</a> a cross-disciplinary program of research, teaching, and policy engagement for the study of abuse in current information technologies. She investigates the spread of narratives across social and traditional media networks.</p>



<p>“I think we need better ways for teaching people to distinguish between rhetoric and reality,” DiResta says, noting that tropes such as “dead people are voting” are commonly repeated and reused from one election cycle to the next, even when they are provably false. These kinds of tropes are the “building blocks” of misinformation campaigns designed to undermine confidence in elections, she says.</p>



<p>“If we can help people recognize the elements of false narratives, maybe they will build up an immunity to them,” DiResta says.</p>



<h2><strong>It’s Not Too Late to Stop the Train</strong></h2>



<p>The phenomenon we recognize today as “social media” only began taking shape in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It is barely two decades old, which makes it far too young to have developed iron-clad traditions. It is an immature field by any measure, and it’s not too late to alter its course.</p>



<p>Moreover, social media’s business model is not terribly complicated, and it’s easy to envision a variety of other models that might be equally or even more profitable, and represent far less of a threat to society. Newer platforms such as Substack, Patreon, OnlyFans, Buy Me a Coffee, and Display Social are opening the door to a creator-centric social media industry that isn’t fueled primarily by advertising dollars.</p>



<p>“Social media has its positives, and it isn’t all doom and gloom, but it certainly isn’t perfect and resolving some of these issues could ensure these applications are the fun and happy escape they need to be,” says Ella Chambers, UX designer and creator&nbsp;of the UK-based <a href="https://www.theethicalsocialmediaproject.com/">Ethical Social Media Project</a>. “The majority of social media is okay.”</p>



<p>That said, some of the problems created by social media are far from trivial. “My research led me to conclude that the rise of social media has brought the downfall of many users’ mental health,” Chambers says. A&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039" target="_blank">recent series of investigative articles in the Wall Street Journal</a>&nbsp;casts a harsh spotlight on the mental health risks of social media, especially to teen-age girls. Facebook has issued a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/research-teen-well-being-and-instagram/" target="_blank">rebuttal</a><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;to the WSJ, but it’s not likely to persuade critics into believing that social media is some kind of wonderful playground for kids and teens.</p>



<p>Creating a practical framework of ethical guidelines would be a positive step forward. Ideally, the framework would evolve into a set of common practices and processes for ensuring fairness, diversity, inclusion, equity, safety, accuracy, accountability, and transparency in social media.</p>



<p>Chinese officials recently unveiled a comprehensive draft of proposed rules governing the use of recommendation algorithms in China.<sup>2</sup> One of the proposed regulations would require algorithm providers to “respect social ethics and ethics, abide by business ethics and professional ethics, and follow the principles of fairness, openness, transparency, scientific rationality, and honesty.”</p>



<p>Another proposed regulation would provide users with “convenient options to turn off algorithm recommendation services” and enable users to select, modify or delete user tags. And another proposed rule would restrict service providers from using algorithms “to falsely register accounts … manipulate user accounts, or falsely like, comment, forward, or navigate through web pages to implement traffic fraud or traffic hijacking …”</p>



<p>Eloy Sasot, group chief data and analytics officer at Richemont, the Switzerland-based&nbsp;luxury goods&nbsp;holding company, agrees that regulations are necessary. “And the regulations also should be managed with extreme care. When you add rules to an already complex system, there can be unintended consequences, both at the AI-solution level and the macro-economic level,” he says.</p>



<p>For instance, small companies, which have limited resources, may be less able to counter negative business impacts created by regulations targeting large companies. “So, in effect, regulations, if not carefully supervised, might result in a landscape that is less competitive and more monopolistic, with unintended consequences for end consumers whom the regulations were designed to protect,” he explains.</p>



<h2><strong>Technology Problem, or a People Problem?</strong></h2>



<p>Casey Fiesler&nbsp;is an assistant professor&nbsp;in the Department of Information Science at University of Colorado Boulder. She researches and teaches in the areas of technology ethics, internet law and policy, and online communities.</p>



<p>“I do not think that social media—or more broadly, online communities—are inherently harmful,” says Fiesler. “In fact, online communities have also done incredible good, especially in terms of social support and activism.”</p>



<p>But the harm caused by unfettered use of social media “often impacts marginalized and vulnerable users disproportionately,” she notes. Ethical social media platforms would consider those effects and work proactively to reduce or eliminate hate speech, trolling, defamation, cyber bullying, swatting, doxing, impersonation, and the intentional spread of false narratives.</p>



<p>“I consider myself an optimist who thinks that it is very important to think like a pessimist. And we should critique technology like social media because it has so much potential for good, and if we want to see those benefits, then we need to push for it to be better,” Fiesler&nbsp;says.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the future of ethical social media may depend more on the behaviors of people than on advances in technology.</p>



<p>“It’s not the medium that’s unethical—it’s the business people controlling it,” Dyson observes. “Talking about social media ethics is like talking about telephone ethics. It really depends on the people involved, not the platform.”</p>



<p>From Dyson’s point of view, the quest for ethical social media represents a fundamental challenge for society. “Are parents teaching their children to behave ethically? Are parents serving as role models for ethical behavior? We talk a lot about training AI, but are we training our children to think long-term, or just to seek short-term relief? Addiction is not about pleasure; it’s about relief from discomfort, from anxiety, from uncertainty, from a sense that we have no future,” she adds. “I personally think we’re just being blind to the consequences of short-term thinking. Silicon Valley is addicted to profits and exponential growth. But we need to start thinking about what we’re creating for the long term.”</p>

<p>Communal devices in our homes and offices aren’t quite right. In previous articles, we discussed the <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/communal-computing/">history of communal computing and the origin of the single user model</a>. Then we reviewed the <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/communal-computings-many-problems/">problems that arise due to identity, privacy, security, experience, and ownership issues</a>. They aren’t solvable by just making a quick fix. They require a huge reorientation in how these devices are framed and designed. </p>



<p>This article focuses on modeling the communal device you want to build and understanding how it fits into the larger context. This includes how it interoperates with services that are connected, and how it communicates across boundaries with other devices in peoples’ homes. Ignore these warnings at your own peril. They can always unplug the device and recycle it.</p>



<p>Let’s first talk about how we gain an understanding of the environment inside homes and offices.</p>



<h3>Mapping the communal space</h3>



<p>We have seen a long list of problems that keep communal computing from aligning with people’s needs. This misalignment arises from the assumption that there is a single relationship between a person and a device, rather than between all the people involved and their devices. </p>



<p>Dr. S.A. Applin has referred to this assumption as “design individualism”; it is a common misframing used by technology organizations. She uses this term most recently in the paper “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666659621000032">Facebook&#8217;s Project Aria indicates problems for responsible innovation when broadly deploying AR and other pervasive technology in the Commons</a>:”</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Unfortunately, this is not an uncommon assumption in technology companies, but is a flaw in conceptual modelling that can cause great problems when products based on this ‘design individualism’ are deployed into the Commons (Applin, 2016b). In short, Facebook acknowledges the plural of ‘people’, but sees them as individuals collectively, not as a collective that is enmeshed, intertwined and exists based on multiple, multiplex, social, technological, and socio-technological relationships as described through [<a href="https://posr.org/wiki/Main_Page">PolySocial Reality</a>].”</p></blockquote>



<p><a href="https://posr.org/wiki/Main_Page">PolySocial Reality (PoSR)</a> is a theory described in a series of papers by Applin and Fisher (2010-ongoing) on the following:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“[PoSR] models the outcomes when all entities in networks send both synchronous and asynchronous messages to maintain social relationships. These messages can be human-to-human, human-to-machine, and machine-to-machine. PoSR contains the entirety of all messages at all times between all entities, and we can use this idea to understand how various factors in the outcomes from the way that messages are sent and received, can impact our ability to communicate, collaborate, and most importantly, cooperate with each other.”</p></blockquote>



<p>In the case of PoSR, we need to consider how agents make decisions about the messages between entities. The designers of these non-human entities will make decisions that impact all entities in a system.</p>



<p>The reality is that the “self” only exists as <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/the-self-is-not-singular-but-a-fluid-network-of-identities">part of a larger network</a>. It is the connections between us and the rest of the network that is meaningful. We pull all of the pseudo identities for those various connections together to create our “one” self.</p>



<p>The model that I’ve found most helpful to address this problem attempts to describe the complete environment of the communal space. It culminates in a map of the connections between nodes, or relationships between entities. This web of interactions includes all the individuals, the devices they use, and the services that intermediate them. The key is to understand how non-human entities intermediate the humans, and how those messages eventually make it to human actors.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/sSvfMJ84vO_LHJCB3nfs3s4sv_aaSQPTyiezAkS9AzTk_9ToSfJpgeMxAbIGqW5gHwb16KGMbwBhCfisCG4c9Ec5p29OgG6wR2qWfhHmVJf9hDc4_VZUqrWNTu7z9HNmLA" alt="" /><figcaption><br><br>The home is a network, like an ecosystem, of people, devices, and services all interacting to create an experience. It is connected with services, people, and devices outside the home as well as my mom, my mom’s picture frame, and Google’s services that enable it.</figcaption></figure>



<p>To see why this map is helpful, consider an ecosystem (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_web">food web</a>). When we only consider interactions between individual animals, like a wolf eating a sheep, we ignore how the changes in population of each animal impacts other actors in the web: too many wolves mean the sheep population dies off. In turn, this change has an impact on other elements of the ecosystem like how much the grass grows. Likewise, when we only consider a single person interacting with one device, we find that most interactions are simple: some input from the user is followed by a response from the device. We often don’t consider other people interacting with the device, nor do we consider how other personal devices exist within that space. We start to see these interactions when we consider other people in the communal space, the new communal device, and all other personal devices. In a communal map, these all interact.</p>



<p>These ecosystems already exist within a home or office. They are made up of items ranging from refrigerator magnets for displaying physical pictures to a connected TV, and they include personal smartphones. The ecosystem extends to the services that the devices connect to outside the home, and to the other people whom they intermediate. We get an incomplete picture if we don’t consider the entire graph. Adding a new device isn’t about filling a specific gap in the ecosystem. The ecosystem may have many problems or challenges, but the ecosystem isn’t actively seeking to solve them. The new device needs to adapt and find its own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_niche">niche</a>. This includes making the ecosystem more beneficial to the device, something that evolutionary biologists call <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2018.2603">‘niche expansion’</a>. Technologists would think about this as building a need for their services.</p>



<p>Thinking about how a device creates a space within an already complex ecosystem is key to understanding what kinds of experiences the team building the device should create. It will help us do things like building for everyone and evolving with the space. It will also help us to avoid the things we should not do, like assuming that every device has to do everything. </p>



<h3>Do’s and don’ts of building communal devices</h3>



<p>With so much to consider when building communal devices, where do you start? Here are a few do’s and don’ts:</p>



<h4><strong>Do user research in the users’ own environment</strong></h4>



<p>Studying and understanding expectations and social norms is the key discovery task for building communal devices. Expectations and norms dictate the rules of the environment into which your device needs to fit, including people’s pseudo-identities, their expectations around privacy, and how willing they are to deal with the friction of added security. Just doing a survey isn’t enough.&nbsp; Find people who are willing to let you see how they use these devices in their homes, and ask lots of questions about how they feel about the devices.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“If you are going to deal with social, people, communal, community, and general sociability, I would suggest hiring applied anthropologists and/or other social scientists on product teams. These experts will save you time and money, by providing you with more context and understanding of what you are making and its impact on others. This translates into more accurate and useful results.” </p><cite>&#8211; Dr. S.A. Applin</cite></blockquote>



<p>Observing where the devices are placed and how the location’s use changes over time will give you fascinating insights about the context in which the device is used. A living room may be a children’s play area in the morning, a home office in the middle of the day, and a guest bedroom at night. People in these contexts have different sets of norms and privacy expectations. </p>



<p>As part of the user research, you should be building an ecosystem graph of all people present and the devices that they use. What people not present are intermediated by technology? Are there stories where this intermediation went wrong? Are there frictions that are created between people that your device should address? Are there frictions that the device should get out of the way of?</p>



<h4><strong>Do build for everyone who might have access</strong></h4>



<p>Don’t focus on the identity of the person who buys and sets up the device. You need to consider the identity (or lack) of everyone who could have access. Consider whether they feel that information collected about them violates their desire to control the information (as in Contextual Integrity). This could mean you need to put up walls to prevent users from doing something sensitive without authorization. Using the Zero Trust framework’s “trust engine” concept, you should ask for the appropriate level of authentication before proceeding.</p>



<p>Most of today’s user experience design is focused on making frictionless or seamless experiences. This goal doesn’t make sense when considering a risk tradeoff. In some cases, adding friction increases the chance that a user won’t move forward with a risky action, which could be a good thing. If the potential risk of showing a private picture is high, you should make it harder to show that picture.</p>



<p>Realize you may not always understand the right context. Having good and safe default states for those cases is important. It is your job to adjust or simplify the model so that people can understand and interpret why the device does something.</p>



<h4><strong>Do consider pseudo-identities for individuals and groups</strong></h4>



<p>Avoid singular identities and focus on group pseudo-identities. If users don’t consider these devices their own, why not have the setup experience mirror those expectations? Build device setup, usage, and management around everyone who should have a say in the device’s operation.</p>



<p>Pseudo-identities become very interesting when you start to learn what certain behaviors mean for subgroups. Is this music being played for an individual with particular tastes? Or does the choice reflect a compromise between multiple people in the room? Should it avoid explicit language since there are children present?</p>



<p>Group norms and relationships need to be made more understandable. It will take technology advances to make these norms more visible. These advances include using machine learning to help the device understand what kind of content it is showing, and who (or what) is depicted in that content. Text, image, and video analysis needs to take place to answer the question: what type of content is this and who is currently in that context? It also means using contextual prediction to consider who may be in the room, their relationship to the people in the content, and how they may feel about the content. When in doubt, restrict what you do.</p>



<h4>Do evolve with the space</h4>



<p>As time goes on, life events will change the environment in which the device operates. Try to detect those changes and adapt accordingly. New pseudo-identities could be present, or the identity representing the group may shift. It is like moving into a new home. You may set things up in one way only to find months later there is a better configuration. Be aware of these changes and adapt. </p>



<p>If behavior that would be considered anomalous becomes the norm, something may have changed about the use of that space. Changes in use are usually led by a change in life–for example, someone moving in or out could trigger a change in how a device is used. Unplugging the device and moving it to a different part of the room or to a different shelf symbolizes a new need for contextual understanding. If you detect a change in the environment but don’t know why the change was made, ask.</p>



<h4>Do use behavioral data carefully, or don’t use it at all</h4>



<p>All communal devices end up collecting data. For example, Spotify uses what you are listening to when building recommendation systems. When dealing with behavioral information, the group’s identity is important, not the individual’s. If you don’t know who is in front of the device, you should consider whether you can use that behavioral data at all. Rather than using an individual identity, you may want to default to the group pseudo-identity’s recommendations. What does the whole house usually like to listen to? </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/d5DE4zyTjswiJeWQi5q3yPcr-HofP4npTKlkdfa5--24Xm-7wFPZw3NHycMAm_LZP-iWqwh02gfckLqwR94H1Zx_yvRmZItU5aoAibpIP_oUerXLnptSuO5gk8ndg6gUlw" alt="" /><figcaption><br><br>When the whole family is watching, how do we find a common ground based on all of our preferences, rather than the owner’s? Spotify has a <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/family/">Premium Family package</a> where each person gets a recommended playlist based on everyone’s listening behavior called a <a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/family-mix/">Family Mix</a>, whereas Netflix requires users to choose between individual profiles.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Spotify has <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/family/">family</a> and <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/duo/">couple</a> accounts that allow multiple people to have an account under one bill. Each person gets their own login and recommendations. Spotify gives all sub-accounts on the subscription access to a shared playlist (like a <a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/family-mix/">Family Mix</a>) that makes recommendations based on the group’s preferences.</p>



<p>Spotify, and services like it, should go a step further to reduce the weight of a song in their recommendations algorithm when it is being played on a shared device in a communal place–a kitchen, for example. It’s impossible to know everyone who is in a communal space. There’s a strong chance that a song played in a kitchen may not be preferred by anyone that lives there. To give that particular song a lot of weight will start to change recommendations on the group members’ personal devices.</p>



<p>If you can’t use behavioral data appropriately, don’t bring it into a user’s profile on your services. You should probably not collect it at all until you can handle the many people who could be using the device. Edge processing can allow a device to build context that respects the many people and their pseudo-identities that are at play in a communal environment. Sometimes it is just safer to not track.</p>



<h4>Don’t assume that automation will work in all contexts</h4>



<p>Prediction technology helps communal devices by finding behavior patterns. These patterns allow the device to calculate what content should be displayed and the potential trust. If a student always listens to music after school while doing homework, the device can assume that contextual integrity holds if the student is the only person there. These assumptions get problematic when part of the context is no longer understood, like when the student has other classmates over. That’s when violations of norms or of privacy expectations are likely to occur. If other people are around, different content is being requested, or if it is a different time of day, the device may not know enough to predict the correct information to display.</p>



<p>Amazon’s Alexa has started wading into these waters with their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249044/amazon-alexa-update-proactive-hunches-guard-plus-subscription">Hunches feature</a>. If you say “good night” to Alexa, it can decide to turn off the lights. What happens if someone is quietly reading in the living room when the lights go out?&nbsp; We’ve all accidentally turned the lights out on a friend or partner, but such mistakes quickly become more serious when they’re made by algorithm.</p>



<p>When the prediction algorithm’s confidence is low, it should disengage and try to learn the new behavior. Worst case, just ask the user what is appropriate and gauge the trust vs risk tradeoff accordingly. The more unexpected the context, the less likely it is that the system should presume anything. It should progressively restrict features until it is at its core: for home assistants, that may just mean displaying the current time.</p>



<h4>Don’t include all service functionality on the device</h4>



<p>All product teams consider what they should add next to make a device “fully functional” and reflect all of the service possibilities. For a communal device, you can’t just think about what you could put there; you also have to consider what you will never put there. An example could be allowing access to Gmail messages from a Google Home Hub. If it doesn’t make sense for most people to have access to some feature, it shouldn’t be there in the first place. It just creates clutter and makes the device harder to use. It is entirely appropriate to allow people to change personal preferences and deal with highly personal information on their own, private devices. There is a time and place for the appropriate content.</p>



<p>Amazon has considered whether Echo users should be allowed to complete a purchase, or limit them to just adding items to a shopping list. They have had to add four digit codes and voice profiles. The resulting interface is complex enough to warrant a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_left_v4_sib?ie=UTF8&amp;nodeId=GLSQSWPWZMLR3RA5">top level help article on why people can’t make the purchases</a>.</p>



<p>If you have already built too much, think about how to sunset certain features so that the value and differentiator of your device is clearer. Full access to personal data doesn’t work in the communal experience. It is a chance for some unknown privacy violation to occur.</p>



<h4>Don’t assume your devices will be the only ones</h4>



<p>Never assume that your company’s devices will be the only ones in the space. Even for large companies like Amazon, there is no future in which the refrigerator, oven, and TV will all be Amazon devices (even if they are trying really hard). The communal space is built up over a long time, and devices like refrigerators have lifetimes that <a href="https://www.mrappliance.ca/blog/2016/july/what-is-the-lifespan-of-your-refrigerator-/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%2023rd%20annual,life%20expectancy%20of%208%20years.">can span decades</a>.</p>



<p>Think about how your device might work alongside other devices, including personal devices. To do this, you need to integrate with network services (e.g. Google Calendar) or local device services (e.g. Amazon Ring video feed). This is the case for services within a communal space as well. People have different preferences for the services they use to communicate and entertain themselves. For example, Snapchat’s adoption by 13-24 year olds (<a href="https://zephoria.com/top-10-valuable-snapchat-statistics/#:~:text=90%20percent%20of%20the%20US,75%20percent%20of%20the%20audience.">~90% in the US market</a>) accounts for 70% of its usage. This means that people over 24 years old are using very different services to interact with their family and peers.</p>



<p>Apple’s iOS has started to realize that apps need to ask for permission before collecting information from other devices on a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211870">local network</a>. It verifies that an app is allowed to access other devices on the network. Local network access is not a foregone conclusion either: different routers and wifi access points are increasingly managed by network providers.</p>



<p>Communal device manufacturers must build for interoperability between devices whether they like it or not, taking into account industry standards for communicating state, messaging, and more. A device that isn’t networked with the other devices in the home is much more likely to be replaced when the single, non-networked use is no longer valid or current.</p>



<h4>Don’t change the terms without an ‘out’ for owners</h4>



<p>Bricking a device because someone doesn’t want to pay for a subscription or doesn’t like the new data use policy is bad. Not only will it create distrust in users but it violates the idea that they are purchasing something for their home.</p>



<p>When you need to change terms, allow owners to make a decision about whether they want new functionality or to stop getting updates. Not having an active subscription is no excuse for a device to fail, since devices should be able to work when a home’s WiFi is down or when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/01/amazon-web-services-outage-smart-homes">AWS has a problem that stops a home’s light bulbs from working</a>. Baseline functionality should always be available, even if leading edge features (for example, features using machine learning) require a subscription. “Smart” or not, there should be no such thing as a light bulb that can’t be turned on.</p>



<p>When a company can no longer support a device–either because they’re sunsetting it or, in the worst case, because they are going out of business–they should consider how to allow people to keep using their devices. In some cases, a motivated community can take on the support; this happened with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18682780/jibo-death-server-update-social-robot-mourning">the Jibo community when the device creator shut down</a>.</p>



<h4>Don’t require personal mobile apps to use the device</h4>



<p>One bad limitation that I’ve seen is requiring an app to be installed on the purchaser’s phone, and requiring the purchaser to be logged in to use the device. Identity and security aren’t always necessary, and being too strict about identity tethers the device to a particular person’s phone.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/products/smart-lightbulbs">Philips Hue</a> smart light bulbs are a way to turn any light fixture into a component in a smart lighting system. However, you need one of their <a href="https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/explore-hue/appshttps://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/explore-hue/apps">branded apps</a> to control the lightbulbs. If you integrate your lighting system with your Amazon or Google accounts, you still need to know what the bulb or “zone” of your house is called. As a host you end up having to take the action for someone else (say by yelling at your Echo for them) or put a piece of paper in the room with all of the instructions. We are back in the age of overly complicated instructions to turn on a TV and AV system.</p>



<p>In addition to making sure you can integrate with other touch and voice interfaces, you need to consider physical ways to allow anyone to interact. IoT power devices like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Etekcity-Voltson-Outlet-Monitoring-Required/dp/B074GVPYPY">VeSync Smart Plug by Etekcity</a> (I have a bunch around the house) have a physical button to allow manual switching, in addition to integrating with your smart home or using their branded apps. If you can’t operate the device manually if you are standing in front of it, is it really being built for everyone in the home?</p>



<h3>How do you know you got this right? </h3>



<p>Once you have implemented all of the recommendations, how do you know you are on the right track? </p>



<p>A simple way to figure out whether you are building a communal-friendly device is to look for people adding their profiles to the device. This means linking their accounts to other services like Spotify (if you allow that kind of linking). However, not everyone will want to or be able to add their accounts, especially people who are passing through (guests) or who cannot legally consent (children).</p>



<p>Using behavior to detect whether someone else is using the device can be difficult. While people don’t change their taste in music or other interests quickly, they slowly drift through the space of possible options. We seek things that are similar to what we like, but <a href="https://medium.com/people-ai-research/just-different-enough-ai-recommendations-newsfeeds-jokes-and-civil-society-c0704bc7a548">just different enough</a> to be novel. In fact, we see that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/10/opinion/sunday/favorite-songs.html">most of our music tastes are set in our teenage years</a>. Therefore, if a communal device is asked to play songs in a different language or genre whereas a personal device does not, it’s more likely that someone new is listening than that the owner has suddenly learned a new language. Compare what users are doing on your device to their behavior on other platforms (for example, compare a Google Home Hub in the kitchen to a personal iPhone) to determine whether new users are accessing the platform.</p>



<p>Behavioral patterns can also be used to predict demographic information. For example, you may be able to predict that someone is a parent based on their usage patterns. If this confidence is high, and you only see their interests showing up in the behavioral data, that means that other people who are around the device are not using it.</p>



<p>Don’t forget that you can ask the users themselves about who is likely to use the device. This is information that you can collect during initial setup. This can help ensure you are not making incorrect assumptions about the placement and use of the device.</p>



<p>Finally, consider talking with customers about how they use the device, the issues that come up, and how it fits into their lives. Qualitative user research doesn’t end after the initial design phase. You need to be aware of how the device has changed the environment it fits into. Without social scientists you can’t know this.</p>



<h4>Is everything a communal experience? </h4>



<p>Up until this point we have been talking about devices that are part of the infrastructure of a home, like a smart screen or light switch. Once we realize that technology serves as an intermediary between people, everything is communal.</p>



<p>Inside of a home, roommates generally have to share expenses like utilities with each other. Companies like <a href="https://www.klarna.com/uk/blog/sharing-your-home-and-money/">Klarna</a> and <a href="https://braid.co/">Braid</a> make finances communal. How you pay together is an important aspect to harmony within a home.</p>



<p>You are also part of communities in your neighborhoods. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-amazon-sidewalk-works/">Amazon Sidewalk</a> extends your devices into the neighborhood you live in. This mesh technology starts to map and extend further with each communal space. Where does your home’s communal space end? If you misplaced your keys a block away, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Tile/Tile/page/9F8516EE-7F3B-4C96-8287-D795123CF742">Tile</a> could help you find them. It could also identify people in your neighborhood without considering your neighbors’ privacy expectations.</p>



<p>Communities aren’t just based on proximity. We can extend the household to connect with other households far away. Amazon’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_left_v4_sib?ie=UTF8&amp;nodeId=GS3WRTSRKD2U6MCK">Drop In</a> has started their own calling network between households. <a href="https://www.loopfamily.com/">Loop</a>, a new startup, is focused on building a device for connecting families in their own social network. </p>



<p>Google/Alphabet’s <a href="https://www.sidewalklabs.com/">Sidewalk Labs</a> has taken on projects that aim to make the connected world part of the cityscape. An early project called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkNYC">LinkNYC</a> (owned through a shell corporation) was digital signage that included free calling and USB hubs. This changed how homeless people used the built environment. When walking down the street you could see people’s smartphones dangling from a LinkNYC while they were panhandling nearby. Later, a district-wide project called <a href="https://www.sidewalktoronto.ca/innovations/public-realm/">Sidewalk Toronto</a> withdrew their proposal rather than it being officially rejected by voters. Every object within the urban environment becomes something that not only collects data but that could be interactive. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/dtorIpi6uLY6vTojBGIHX0rvi2xZ2a6lYbAuCcNolsN1jiiXYcTk7F4HhoSC0qkf3oYU6UQNtKm6gA_R6VmhCUsjFwps0UUdLEbFM9_sZBNWqKCZJNMWwdX90vxKsqpt2A" alt="" /><figcaption><br>The town square and public park has been built to be welcoming to people and set expectations of what they do there, unlike online social media. <a href="https://newpublic.org/">New Public</a> is taking cues from this type of physical shared space for reimagining the online public square.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Taking cues from the real world, groups like <a href="https://newpublic.org/signals">New Public</a> are asking what would happen if we built social media the same way we build public spaces. What if social media followed the norms that we have in social spaces like the public parks or squares?</p>



<p>A key aspect to communal computing is the natural limitations of physical and temporal use. Only so many people can fit inside a kitchen or a meeting room. Only so many people can use a device at once, even if it is a subway ticket machine that services millions of people per month. Only so many can fit onto a sidewalk. We need to consider the way that space and time play a part in these experiences.</p>



<h3>Adapt or be unplugged</h3>



<p>Rethinking how people use devices together inside our homes, offices, and other spaces is key to the future of ubiquitous computing. We have a long way to go in understanding how context changes the expectations and norms of the people in those spaces. Without updating how we design and build these devices, the device you build will just be one more addition to the landfill.</p>



<p>To understand how devices are used in these spaces, we need to expand our thinking beyond the single owner and design for communal use from the start. If we don’t, the devices will never fit properly into our shared and intimate spaces. The mismatch between expectations and what is delivered will grow greater and lead to more dire problems.</p>



<p>This is a call for change in how we consider devices integrated into our lives. We shouldn’t assume that because humans are adaptive, we can adapt to the technologies built. We should design the technologies to fit into our lives, making sure the devices understand the context in which they’re working. </p>



<p>The future of computing that is contextual, is communal.</p>



<p>   </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The concept behind ransomware is simple. An attacker plants malware on your system that encrypts all the files, making your system useless, then offers to sell you the key you need to decrypt the files. Payment is usually in bitcoin (BTC), and the decryption key is deleted if you don’t pay within a certain period. Payments have typically been relatively small—though that’s obviously no longer true, with <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22428774/ransomeware-pipeline-colonial-darkside-gas-prices">Colonial Pipeline</a>’s multimillion-dollar payout.</p>



<p>Recently, ransomware attacks have been coupled with extortion: the malware sends valuable data (for example, a database of credit card numbers) back to the attacker, who then threatens to publish the data online if you don’t comply with the request.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A survey on O’Reilly’s website<sup>1</sup> showed that 6% of the respondents worked for organizations that were victims of ransomware attacks. How do you avoid joining them? We’ll have more to say about that, but the tl;dr is simple: pay attention to security basics. Strong passwords, two-factor authentication, defense in depth, staying on top of software updates, good backups, and the ability to restore from backups go a long way. Not only do they protect you from becoming a ransomware victim, but those basics can also help protect you from data theft, cryptojacking, and most other forms of cybercrime. The sad truth is that few organizations practice good security hygiene—and those that don’t end up paying the price.</p>



<p>But what about ransomware? Why is it such an issue, and how is it evolving? Historically, ransomware has been a relatively easy way to make money: set up operations in a country that’s not likely to investigate cybercrime, attack targets that are more likely to pay a ransom, keep the ransom small so it’s easier to pay than to restore from backup, and accept payment via some medium that’s perceived as anonymous. Like most things on the internet, ransomware’s advantage is scale: The WannaCry attack infected around 230,000 systems. If even a small percentage paid the US$300 ransom, that’s a lot of money.</p>



<p>Early on, attacks focused on small and midsize businesses, which often have limited IT staff and no professional security specialists. But more recently, hospitals, governments, and other organizations with valuable data have been attacked. A modern hospital can’t operate without patient data, so restoring systems is literally a matter of <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/2021/01/05/death-by-ransomware-healthcare-cybersecurity/">life and death</a>. Most recently, we’ve seen attacks against large enterprises, like Colonial Pipeline. And this move toward bigger targets, with more valuable data, has been accompanied by larger ransoms.</p>



<p>Attackers have also gotten more sophisticated and <a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2021-06-ransomware-dark-webs-cybercriminals-collaborate.html">specialized</a>. They’ve set up help desks and customer service agents (much like any other company) to help customers make their payments and decrypt their data. Some criminal organizations offer “ransomware as a service,” running attacks for customers. Others develop the software or create the attacks that find victims. Initiating an attack doesn’t require any technical knowledge; it can all be contracted out, and the customer gets a nice dashboard to show the attack’s progress.</p>



<p>While it’s easy to believe (and probably correct) that government actors have gotten into the game, it’s important to keep in mind that attribution of an attack is very difficult—not least because of the number of actors involved. An “as a service” operator really doesn’t care who its clients are, and its clients may be (willingly) unaware of exactly what they’re buying. Plausible deniability is also a service.</p>



<h3>How an attack begins</h3>



<p>Ransomware attacks frequently start with phishing. An email to a victim entices them to open an attachment or to visit a website that installs malware. So the first thing you can do to prevent ransomware attacks is to make sure everyone is aware of phishing, very skeptical of any attachments they receive, and appropriately cautious about the websites they visit. Unfortunately, teaching people how to avoid being victimized by a phish is a battle you’re not likely to win. Phishes are getting increasingly sophisticated and now do a good job of impersonating people the victim knows. <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3334617/what-is-spear-phishing-why-targeted-email-attacks-are-so-difficult-to-stop.html">Spear phishing</a> requires extensive research, and ransomware criminals have typically tried to compromise systems in bulk. But recently, we’ve been seeing attacks against more valuable victims. Larger, more valuable targets, with correspondingly bigger payouts, will merit the investment in research.</p>



<p>It’s also possible for an attack to start when a victim visits a legitimate but compromised website. In some cases, an attack can start without any action by the victim. Some ransomware (for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack">WannaCry</a>) can spread directly from computer to computer. One recent attack started through a <a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/07/02/kaseya-vsa-supply-chain-ransomware-attack">supply chain compromise</a>: attackers planted the ransomware in an enterprise security product, which was then distributed unwittingly to the product’s customers. Almost any vulnerability can be exploited to plant a ransomware payload on a victim’s device. Keeping browsers up-to-date helps to defend against compromised websites.</p>



<p>Most ransomware attacks begin on Windows systems or on mobile phones. This isn’t to imply that macOS, Linux, and other operating systems are less vulnerable; it’s just that other attack vectors are more common. We can guess at some reasons for this. Mobile phones move between different domains, as the owner goes from a coffee shop to home to the office, and are exposed to different networks with different risk factors. Although they are often used in risky territory, they’re rarely subject to the same device management that’s applied to “company” systems—but they’re often accorded the same level of trust. Therefore, it’s relatively easy for a phone to be compromised outside the office and then bring the attacker onto the corporate network when its owner returns to work.</p>



<p>It’s possible that Windows systems are common attack vectors just because there are so many of them, particularly in business environments. Many also believe that Windows users install updates less often than macOS and Linux users. Microsoft does a good job of patching vulnerabilities before they can be exploited, but that doesn’t do any good if updates aren’t installed. For example, Microsoft discovered and patched the vulnerability that WannaCry exploited well before the attacks began, but many individuals, and many companies, never installed the updates.</p>



<h3>Preparations and precautions</h3>



<p>The best defense against ransomware is to be prepared, starting with basic security hygiene. Frankly, this is true of any attack: get the basics right and you’ll have much less to worry about. If you’ve defended yourself against ransomware, you’ve done a lot to defend yourself against data theft, cryptojacking, and many other forms of cybercrime.</p>



<p>Security hygiene is simple in concept but hard in practice. It starts with passwords: Users must have nontrivial passwords. And they should never give their password to someone else, whether or not “someone else” is on staff (or claims to be). </p>



<p>Two-factor authentication (2FA), which requires something in addition to a password (for example, biometric authentication or a text message sent to a cell phone) is a must. Don’t just recommend 2FA; require it. Too many organizations buy and install the software but never require their staff to use it. (76% of the respondents to our survey said that their company used 2FA; 14% said they weren’t sure.)</p>



<p>Users should be aware of phishing and be extremely skeptical of email attachments that they weren’t expecting and websites that they didn’t plan to visit. It’s always a good practice to type URLs in yourself, rather than clicking on links in email—even those in messages that appear to be from friends or associates. Users should be aware of phishing and be extremely skeptical of email attachments that they weren’t expecting and websites that they didn’t plan to visit. It’s always a good practice to type URLs in yourself, rather than clicking on links in email—even those in messages that appear to be from friends or associates.</p>



<p>Backups are absolutely essential. But what’s even more important is the ability to restore from a backup. The easiest solution to ransomware is to reformat the disks and restore from backup. Unfortunately, few companies have good backups or the ability to restore from a backup—one security expert guesses that it’s as low as 10%. Here are a few key points:</p>



<ul><li>You actually have to do the backups. (Many companies don’t.) Don’t rely solely on cloud storage; backup on physical drives that are disconnected when a backup isn’t in progress. (70% of our survey respondents said that their company performed backups regularly.)</li><li>You have to test the backups to ensure that you can restore the system. If you have a backup but can’t restore, you’re only pretending that you have a backup. (Only 48% of the respondents said that their company regularly practiced restoring from backups; 36% said they didn’t know.)</li><li>The backup device needs to be offline, connected only when a backup is in progress. Otherwise, it’s possible for the ransomware attack to encrypt your backup.</li></ul>



<p>Don’t overlook testing your backups. Your business continuity planning should include ransomware scenarios: how do you continue doing business while systems are being restored? Chaos engineering, an approach developed at Netflix, is a good idea. Make a practice of breaking your storage capability, then restoring it from backup. Do this monthly—if possible, schedule it with the product and project management teams. Testing the ability to restore your production systems isn’t just about proving that everything works; it’s about training staff to react calmly in a crisis and resolve the outage efficiently. When something goes bad, you don’t want to be on Stack Overflow asking how to do a restore. You want that knowledge imprinted in everyone’s brains.</p>



<p>Keep operating systems and browsers up-to-date. Too many have become victims because of a vulnerability that was patched in a software update that they didn’t install. (79% of our survey respondents said that their company had processes for updating critical software, including browsers.)</p>



<p>An important principle in any kind of security is “least privilege.” No person or system should be authorized to do anything it doesn’t need to do. For example, no one outside of HR should have access to the employee database. “Of course,” you say—but that includes the CEO. No one outside of sales should have access to the customer database. And so on. Least privilege works for software too. Services need access to other services—but services must authenticate to each other and should only be able to make requests appropriate to their role. Any unexpected request should be rejected and treated as a signal that the software has been compromised. And least privilege works for hardware, whether virtual or physical: finance systems and servers shouldn’t be able to access HR systems, for example. Ideally, they should be on separate networks. You should have a “defense in depth” security strategy that focuses not only on keeping “bad guys” out of your network but also on limiting where they can go once they’re inside. You want to stop an attack that originates on HR systems from finding its way to the finance systems or some other part of the company. Particularly when you’re dealing with ransomware, making it difficult for an attack to propagate from one system to another is all-important.</p>



<p>Attribute-based access control (ABAC) can be seen as an extension of least privilege. ABAC is based on defining policies about exactly who and what should be allowed to access every service: What are the criteria on which trust should be based? And how do these criteria change over time? If a device suddenly moves between networks, does that represent a risk? If a system suddenly makes a request that it has never made before, has it been compromised? At what point should access to services be denied? ABAC, done right, is difficult and requires a lot of human involvement: looking at logs, deciding what kinds of access are appropriate, and keeping policies up-to-date as the situation changes. Working from home is an example of a major change that security people will need to take into account. You might have “trusted” an employee’s laptop, but should you trust it when it’s on the same network as their children? Some of this can be automated, but the bottom line is that you can’t automate security. </p>



<p>Finally: detecting a ransomware attack isn’t difficult. If you think about it, this makes a lot of sense: encrypting all your files requires a lot of CPU and filesystem activity, and that’s a red flag. The way files change is also a giveaway. Most unencrypted files have low entropy: they have a high degree of order. (On the simplest level, you can glance at a text file and tell that it’s text. That’s because it has a certain kind of order. Other kinds of files are also ordered, though the order isn’t as apparent to a human.) Encrypted files have high entropy (i.e., they’re very disordered)—they have to be; otherwise, they’d be easy to decrypt. Computing a file’s entropy is simple and for these purposes doesn’t require looking at the entire file. Many security products for desktop and laptop systems are capable of detecting and stopping a ransomware attack. We don’t do product recommendations, but we do recommend that you research the products that are available. (<em>PC Magazine</em>’s 2021 <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-ransomware-protection">review</a> of ransomware detection products is a good place to start.)</p>



<h3>In the data center or the cloud</h3>



<p>Detecting ransomware once it has escaped into a data center, whether in the cloud or on-premises, isn’t a fundamentally different task, but commercial products aren’t there yet. Again, prevention is the best defense, and the best defense is strong on the fundamentals. Ransomware makes its way from a desktop to a data center via compromised credentials and operating systems that are unpatched and unprotected. We can’t say this too often: make sure secrets are protected, make sure identity and access management are configured correctly, make sure you have a backup strategy (and that the backups work), and make sure operating systems are patched—zero-trust is your friend.</p>



<p>Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud all have services named “Identity and Access Management” (IAM); the fact that they all converged on the same name tells you something about how important it is. These are the services that configure users, roles, and privileges, and they’re the key to protecting your cloud assets. IAM doesn’t have a reputation for being easy. Nevertheless, it’s something you have to get right; misconfigured IAM is at the root of many cloud vulnerabilities. One <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/2020/10/cloud-iam-misconfiguration-risks/">report</a> claims that well over 50% of the organizations using Google Cloud were running workloads with administrator privileges. While that report singles out Google, we believe that the same is true at other cloud providers. All of these workloads are at risk; administrator privileges should only be used for essential management tasks. Google Cloud, AWS, Azure, and the other providers give you the tools you need to secure your workloads, but they can’t force you to use them correctly.</p>



<p>It’s worth asking your cloud vendor some hard questions. Specifically, what kind of support can your vendor give you if you are a victim of a security breach? What can your vendor do if you lose control of your applications because IAM has been misconfigured? What can your vendor do to restore your data if you succumb to ransomware? Don’t assume that everything in the cloud is “backed up” just because it’s in the cloud. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/backup/?whats-new-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&amp;whats-new-cards.sort-order=desc">AWS</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-overview">Azure</a> offer backup services; <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/backup-recovery/backing-up">Google Cloud</a> offers backup services for SQL databases but doesn’t appear to offer anything comprehensive. Whatever your solution, don’t just assume it works. Make sure that your backups can’t be accessed via the normal paths for accessing your services—that’s the cloud version of “leave your physical backup drives disconnected when not in use.” You don’t want an attacker to find your cloud backups and encrypt them too. And finally, test your backups and practice restoring your data. </p>



<p>Any frameworks your IT group has in place for observability will be a big help: Abnormal file activity is always suspicious. Databases that suddenly change in unexpected ways are suspicious. So are services (whether “micro” or “macroscopic”) that suddenly start to fail. If you have built observability into your systems, you’re at least partway there.</p>



<p>How confident are you that you can defend against a ransomware attack? In our survey, 60% of the respondents said that they were confident; another 28% said “maybe,” and 12% said “no.” We’d give our respondents good, but not great, marks on readiness (2FA, software updates, and backups). And we’d caution that confidence is good but overconfidence can be fatal. Make sure that your defenses are in place and that those defenses work.</p>



<h3>If you become a victim</h3>



<p>What do you do? Many organizations just pay. (<a href="https://ransomwhe.re/">Ransomwhe.re</a> tracks total payments to ransomware sites, currently estimated at $92,120,383.83.) The FBI says that you shouldn’t pay, but if you don’t have the ability to restore your systems from backups, you might not have an alternative. Although the FBI was able to recover the ransom paid by Colonial Pipeline, I don’t think there’s any case in which they’ve been able to recover decryption keys.</p>



<p>Whether paying the ransom is a good option depends on how much you trust the cybercriminals responsible for the attack. The common wisdom is that ransomware attackers are trustworthy, that they’ll give you the key you need to decrypt your data and even help you use it correctly. If the word gets out that they can’t be trusted to restore your systems, they’ll find fewer victims willing to pay up. However, at least one security vendor says that 40% of ransomware victims who pay <a href="https://www.acronis.com/en-us/articles/what-is-ransomware/">never get their files restored</a>. That’s a very big “however,” and a very big risk—especially as ransomware demands skyrocket. Criminals are, after all, criminals. It’s all the more reason to have good backups.</p>



<p>There’s another reason not to pay that may be more important. Ransomware is a big business, and like any business, it will continue to exist as long as it’s profitable. Paying your attackers might be an easy solution short-term, but you’re just setting up the next victim. We need to protect each other, and the best way to do that is to make ransomware less profitable.</p>



<p>Another problem that victims face is extortion. If the attackers steal your data in addition to encrypting it, they can demand money not to publish your confidential data online—which may leave you with substantial penalties for exposing private data under laws such as GDPR and CCPA. This secondary attack is becoming increasingly common.</p>



<p>Whether or not they pay, ransomware victims frequently face revictimization because they never fix the vulnerability that allowed the ransomware in the first place. So they pay the ransom, and a few months later, they’re attacked again, using the same vulnerability. The attack may come from the same people or it may come from someone else. Like any other business, an attacker wants to maximize its profits, and that might mean selling the information they used to compromise your systems to other ransomware outfits. If you become a victim, take that as a very serious warning. Don’t think that the story is over when you’ve restored your systems. </p>



<p>Here’s the bottom line, whether or not you pay. If you become a victim of ransomware, figure out how the ransomware got in and plug those holes. We began this article by talking about basic security practices. Keep your software up-to-date. Use two-factor authentication. Implement defense in depth wherever possible. Design zero-trust into your applications. And above all, get serious about backups and practice restoring from backup regularly. You don’t want to become a victim again. </p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/communal-computing/">first article</a> of this series, we discussed communal computing devices and the problems they create–or, more precisely, the problems that arise because we don’t really understand what “communal” means. Communal devices are intended to be used by groups of people in homes and offices. Examples include popular home assistants and smart displays like the Amazon Echo, Google Home, Apple HomePod, and many others.&nbsp; If we don’t create these devices with communities of people in mind, we will continue to build the wrong ones.</p>



<p>Ever since the concept of a “user” was invented (which was probably later than you think), we’ve assumed that devices are “owned” by a single user. Someone buys the device and sets up the account; it’s their device, their account.&nbsp; When we’re building shared devices with a user model, that model quickly runs into limitations. What happens when you want your home assistant to play music for a dinner party, but your preferences have been skewed by your children’s listening habits? We, as users, have certain expectations for what a device should do. But we, as technologists, have typically ignored our own expectations when designing and building those devices.</p>



<p>This expectation isn’t a new one either. The telephone in the kitchen was for everyone’s use. After the release of the iPad in 2010 <a href="https://furbo.org/2010/04/29/communal-computing/">Craig Hockenberry discussed the great value of communal computing but also the concerns</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“When you pass it around, you’re giving everyone who touches it the opportunity to mess with your private life, whether intentionally or not. That makes me uneasy.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Communal computing requires a new mindset that takes into account users’ expectations. If the devices aren’t designed with those expectations in mind, they’re destined for the landfill. Users will eventually experience “weirdness” and “annoyance” that grows to distrust of the device itself. As technologists, we often call these weirdnesses “edge cases.” That’s precisely where we’re wrong: they’re not edge cases, but they’re at the core of how people want to use these devices.</p>



<p>In the first article, we listed five core questions we should ask about communal devices:</p>



<ol><li>Identity: Do we know all of the people who are using the device?</li><li>Privacy: Are we exposing (or hiding) the right content for all of the people with access?</li><li>Security: Are we allowing all of the people using the device to do or see what they should and are we protecting the content from people that shouldn’t?</li><li>Experience: What is the contextually appropriate display or next action?</li><li>Ownership: Who owns all of the data and services attached to the device that multiple people are using?</li></ol>



<p>In this article, we’ll take a deeper look at these questions, to see how the problems manifest and how to understand them.</p>



<h2>Identity</h2>



<p>All of the problems we’ve listed start with the idea that there is one registered and known person who should use the device. That model doesn’t fit reality: the identity of a communal device isn’t a single person, but everyone who can interact with it. This could be anyone able to tap the screen, make a voice command, use a remote, or simply be sensed by it. To understand this communal model and the problems it poses, start with the person who buys and sets up the device. It is associated with that individual’s account, like a personal Amazon account with its order history and shopping list. Then it gets difficult. Who doesn&#8217;t, can’t, or shouldn’t have full access to an Amazon account? Do you want everyone who comes into your house to be able to add something to your shopping list?</p>



<p>If you think about the spectrum of people who could be in your house, they range from people whom you trust, to people who you don’t really trust but who should be there, to those who you&nbsp; shouldn’t trust at all.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/trust-1048x387.png" alt="" class="wp-image-13877" srcset="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/trust-1048x387.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/trust-300x111.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/trust-768x284.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/trust-1536x567.png 1536w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/trust.png 1950w" sizes="(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px" /><figcaption><br>There is a spectrum of trust for people who have access to communal devices</figcaption></figure>



<p>In addition to individuals, we need to consider the groups that each person could be part of. These group memberships are called “pseudo-identities”; they are facets of a person’s full identity. They are usually defined by how the person associated themself with a group of other people. My life at work, home, a high school friends group, and as a sports fan show different parts of my identity. When I’m with other people who share the same pseudo-identity, we can share information. When there are people from one group in front of a device I may avoid showing content that is associated with another group (or another personal pseudo-identity). This can sound abstract, but it isn’t; if you’re with friends in a sports bar, you probably want notifications about the teams you follow. You probably don’t want news about work, unless it’s an emergency.</p>



<p>There are important reasons why we show a particular facet of our identity in a particular context. When designing an experience, you need to consider the identity context and where the experience will take place. Most recently this has come up with work from home. Many people talk about ‘<a href="https://mike-robbins.com/tedxberkeley/">bringing your whole self to work</a>,’ but don&#8217;t realize that “your whole self” isn’t always appropriate. Remote work changes when and where I should interact with work. For a smart screen in my kitchen, it is appropriate to have content that is related to my home and family. Is it appropriate to have all of my work notifications and meetings there? Could it be a problem for children to have the ability to join my work calls? What does my IT group require as far as security of work devices versus personal home devices?</p>



<p>With these devices we may need to switch to a different pseudo-identity to get something done. I may need to be reminded of a work meeting. When I get a notification from a close friend, I need to decide whether it is appropriate to respond based on the other people around me.</p>



<p>The pandemic has broken down the barriers between home and work. The natural context switch from being at work and worrying about work things and then going home to worry about home things is no longer the case. People need to make a conscious effort to “turn off work” and to change the context. Just because it is the middle of the workday doesn’t always mean I want to be bothered by work. I may want to change contexts to take a break. Such context shifts add nuance to the way the current pseudo-identity should be considered, and to the overarching context you need to detect.</p>



<p>Next, we need to consider identities as groups that I belong to. I’m part of my family, and my family would potentially want to talk with other families. I live in a house that is on my street alongside other neighbors. I’m part of an organization that I identify as my work. These are all pseudo-identities we should consider, based on where the device is placed and in relation to other equally important identities.</p>



<p>The crux of the problem with communal devices is the multiple identities that are or may be using the device. This requires greater understanding of who, where, and why people are using the device. We need to consider the types of groups that are part of the home and office.</p>



<h2>Privacy </h2>



<p>As we consider the identities of all people with access to the device, and the identity of the place the device is to be part of, we start to consider what privacy expectations people may have given the context in which the device is used.</p>



<p>Privacy is hard to understand. The framework I’ve found most helpful is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_Integrity">Contextual Integrity</a> which was introduced by Helen Nissenbaum in the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Privacy-Context-Technology-Policy-Integrity/dp/0804752370">Privacy in Context</a>. Contextual Integrity describes four key aspects of privacy:</p>



<ol><li>Privacy is provided by appropriate flows of information.</li><li>Appropriate information flows are those that conform to contextual information norms.</li><li>Contextual informational norms refer to five independent parameters: data subject, sender, recipient, information type, and transmission principle.</li><li>Conceptions of privacy are based on ethical concerns that evolve over time.</li></ol>



<p>What is most important about Contextual Integrity is that privacy is not about hiding information away from the public but giving people a way to control the flow of their own information. The context in which information is shared determines what is appropriate.</p>



<p>This flow either feels appropriate, or not, based on key characteristics of the information (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_Integrity#Contextual_Integrity%E2%80%99s_Parameters">from Wikipedia</a>):</p>



<ol><li>The data subject: Who or what is this about?</li><li>The sender of the data: Who is sending it?</li><li>The recipient of the data: Who will eventually see or get the data?</li><li>The information type: What type of information is this (e.g. a photo, text)?</li><li>The transmission principle: In what set of norms is this being shared (e.g. school, medical, personal communication)?</li></ol>



<p>We rarely acknowledge how a subtle change in one of these parameters could be a violation of privacy. It may be completely acceptable for my friend to have a weird photo of me, but once it gets posted on a company intranet site it violates how I want information (a photo) to flow. The recipient of the data has changed to something I no longer find acceptable. But I might not care whether a complete stranger (like a burglar) sees the photo, as long as it never gets back to someone I know.</p>



<p>For communal use cases, the sender or receiver of information is often a group. There may be&nbsp; multiple people in the room during a video call, not just the person you are calling. People can walk in and out. I might be happy with some people in my home seeing a particular photo, but find it embarrassing if it is shown to guests at a dinner party.</p>



<p>We must also consider what happens when other people’s content is shown to those who shouldn’t see it. This content could be photos or notifications from people outside the communal space that could be seen by anyone in front of the device. Smartphones can hide message contents when you aren’t near your phone for this exact reason.</p>



<p>The services themselves can expand the ‘receivers’ of information in ways that create uncomfortable situations. In Privacy in Context, Nissenbaum talks about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Street_View_privacy_concerns">the privacy implications of Google Street View when it places photos of people’s houses</a> on Google Maps. When a house was only visible to people who walked down the street that was one thing, but when anyone in the world can access a picture of a house, that changes the parameters in a way that causes concern. Most recently, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/12/18262646/ibm-didnt-inform-people-when-it-used-their-flickr-photos-for-facial-recognition-training">IBM used Flickr photos that were shared under a Creative Commons license to train facial recognition algorithms</a>. While this didn’t require any change to terms of the service it was a surprise to people and may be in violation of the Creative Commons license. In the end, IBM took the dataset down.</p>



<p>Privacy considerations for communal devices should focus on who is gaining access to information and whether it is appropriate based on people’s expectations. Without using a framework like contextual inquiry we will be stuck talking about generalized rules for data sharing, and there will always be edge cases that violate someone’s privacy.</p>

<h5>A note about children</h5>



<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color">Children make identity and privacy especially tricky. <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/242074/percentages-of-us-family-households-with-children-by-type/#statisticContainer">About 40% of all households</a> have a child. Children shouldn’t be an afterthought. If you aren’t compliant with local laws you can get in a lot of trouble. In 2019, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/09/youtube-fined-170-million-for-violations-of-childrens-privacy/">YouTube had to settle with the FTC</a> for a $170 million fine for selling ads targeting children. It gets complicated because the ‘age of consent’ depends on the region as well: <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule">COPPA in the US is for people under 13 years old</a>, <a href="https://www.clarip.com/data-privacy/ccpa-kids-consent/">CCPA in California is for people under 16</a>, and <a href="https://www.privo.com/blog/gdpr-age-of-digital-consent">GDPR overall is under 16 years old but each member state can set its own</a>. The moment you acknowledge children are using your platforms, you need to accommodate them.</p>



<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color">For communal devices, there are many use cases for children. Once they realize they can play whatever music they want (including tracks of fart sounds) on a shared device they will do it. Children focus on the <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/08/200812153637.htm">exploration over the task</a> and will end up discovering way more about the device than parents might. Adjusting your practices after building a device is a recipe for failure. You will find that the paradigms you choose for other parties won’t align with the expectations for children, and modifying your software to accommodate children is difficult or impossible. It’s important to account for children from the beginning.</p>

<h2>Security </h2>



<p>To get to a home assistant, you usually need to pass through a home’s outer door. There is usually a physical limitation by way of a lock. There may be alarm systems. Finally, there are social norms: you don’t just walk into someone else’s house without knocking or being invited.</p>



<p>Once you are past all of these locks, alarms, and norms, anyone can access the communal device. Few things within a home are restricted–possibly a safe with important documents. When a communal device requires authentication, it is usually subverted in some way for convenience: for example, a password might be taped to it, or a password may never have been set.</p>



<p>The concept of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zero-Trust-Networks-Building-Untrusted/dp/1491962194">Zero Trust Networks</a> speaks to this problem. It comes down to a key question: is the risk associated with an action greater than the trust we have that the person performing the action is who they say they are?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oIE9EerVy1LX6be50IEGWVshKMNJV47fbOCgQ2n7kHTkmZgEISlRx5t6dmzjDxldR1XlDpaDMFiMFp7rnKnTV3T1RyNXBerEUx9QOy7VsKqfSqbRcIssbDbOfl9yfhwJpmrb3cvv" alt="" /><figcaption><br>Source: <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/zero-trust-networks/9781491962183/">https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/zero-trust-networks/9781491962183/</a> </figcaption></figure>



<p>Passwords, passcodes, or mobile device authentication become nuisances; these supposed secrets are frequently shared between everyone who has access to the device. Passwords might be written down for people who can’t remember them, making them visible to less trusted people visiting your household. Have we not learned anything since the movie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UqEg1cFqig">War Games</a>?</p>



<p>When we consider the risk associated with an action, we need to understand its privacy implications. Would the action expose someone’s information without their knowledge? Would it allow a person to pretend to be someone else? Could another party tell easily the device was being used by an imposter?</p>



<p>There is a tradeoff between the trust and risk. The device needs to calculate whether we know who the person is and whether the person wants the information to be shown. That needs to be weighed against the potential risk or harm if an inappropriate person is in front of the device.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/HS9D_BfERJDalfgZqmP54N9LcJNKB9jsfciGJGjHwwY01hMgMDs6p4Hrivp-nUmtMbLuoiTX1MxGwBKbLRfqvpCiHeou88dgaV7MRpv1cU852iH75aFunOMRY7amt1-6nEbGJxNS" alt="" /><figcaption><br>Having someone in your home accidentally share embarrassing photos could have social implications.</figcaption></figure>



<p>A few examples of this tradeoff:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class=""><tbody><tr><td><strong>Feature</strong></td><td><strong>Risk and trust calculation</strong></td><td><strong>Possible issues</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Showing a photo when the device detects someone in the room</td><td>Photo content sensitivity, who is in the room&nbsp;</td><td>Showing an inappropriate photo to a complete stranger</td></tr><tr><td>Starting a video call</td><td>Person’s account being used for the call, the actual person starting the call</td><td>When the other side picks up it may not be who they thought it would be</td></tr><tr><td>Playing a personal song playlist</td><td>Personal recommendations being impacted</td><td>Incorrect future recommendations</td></tr><tr><td>Automatically ordering something based on a voice command</td><td>Convenience of ordering, approval of the shopping account’s owner</td><td>Shipping an item that shouldn’t have been ordered</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>This gets even trickier when people no longer in the home can access the devices remotely. There have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/23/technology/smart-home-devices-domestic-abuse.html">cases of harassment, intimidation, and domestic abuse</a> by people whose access should have been revoked: for example, an ex-partner turning off the heating system. When should someone be able to access communal devices remotely? When should their access be controllable from the devices themselves? How should people be reminded to update their access control lists? How does basic security maintenance happen inside a communal space? </p>



<p>See how much work this takes in a <a href="https://twitter.com/bryanmcaninch/status/1396099891802353671">recent account of pro bono security work</a> for a harassed mother and her son. Or how a <a href="https://twitter.com/_DanielSinclair/status/1405686762563719174">YouTuber was blackmailed, surveilled, and harassed by her smart home</a>. <a href="https://manuals.info.apple.com/MANUALS/1000/MA1976/en_US/device-and-data-access-when-personal-safety-is-at-risk.pdf">Apple even has a manual</a> for this type of situation.</p>



<p>At home, where there’s no corporate IT group to create policies and automation to keep things secure, it’s next to impossible to manage all of these security issues. Even some corporations have trouble with it. We need to figure out how users will maintain and configure a communal device over time. Configuration for devices in the home and office can be wrought with lots of different types of needs over time.</p>



<p>For example, what happens when someone leaves the home and is no longer part of it? We will need to remove their access and may even find it necessary to block them from certain services. This is highlighted with the cases of harassment of people through spouses that still control the communal devices. Ongoing maintenance of a particular device could also be triggered by a change in needs by the community. A home device may be used to just play music or check the weather at first. But when a new baby comes home, being able to do video calling with close relatives may become a higher priority.</p>



<p>End users are usually very bad at changing configuration after it is set. They may not even know that they can configure something in the first place. This is why people have made a business out of setting up home stereo and video systems. People just don’t understand the technologies they are putting in their houses. Does that mean we need some type of handy-person that does home device setup and management? When more complicated routines are required to meet the needs, how does someone allow for changes without writing code, if they are allowed to?</p>



<p>Communal devices need new paradigms of security that go beyond the standard login. The world inside a home is protected by a barrier like a locked door; the capabilities of communal devices should respect that. This means both removing friction in some cases and increasing it in others.</p>

<h5>A note about biometrics</h5>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/qbw387_ORSOiu1Mgg3qhPgTkqbswCa4_ErEyVBjfNVjyUK10Qsp1OoxXif2W4g_p11GP9kwIEW_19G1nV0p8I_zggBTciyFLHaB82PBkuN3PMWSJLNaGRCtUGB77CmAN7IeFbYVb" alt="" /><figcaption><br>&nbsp;“Turn your face” to enroll in Google Face Match and personalize your devices.<br><em>(Source: Google Face Match video, <a href="https://youtu.be/ODy_xJHW6CI?t=26">https://youtu.be/ODy_xJHW6CI?t=26</a>) </em></figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color">Biometric authentication for voice and face recognition can help us get a better understanding of who is using a device. Examples of biometric authentication include <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208108">FaceID</a> for the iPhone and voice profiles for Amazon Alexa. There is a push for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393873/ftc-ai-machine-learning-race-gender-bias-legal-violation">regulation of facial recognition technologies</a>, but opt-in for authentication purposes tends to be carved out.</p>



<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color">However, biometrics aren’t without problems. In addition to issues with <a href="http://gendershades.org/overview.html">skin tone, gender bias</a>, and <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2020/03/23/automated-speech-recognition-less-accurate-blacks/">local accents</a>, biometrics assumes that everyone is willing to have a biometric profile on the device–and that they would be legally allowed to (for example, children may not be allowed to consent to a biometric profile). It also assumes this technology is secure. <a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9320885?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en">Google FaceMatch makes it very clear it is only a technology for personalization,</a> rather than authentication. I can only guess they have legalese to avoid liability when an unauthorized person spoofs someone’s face, say by taking a photo off the wall and showing it to the device.</p>



<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color">What do we mean by “personalization?” When you walk into a room and FaceMatch identifies your face, the Google Home Hub dings, shows your face icon, then shows your calendar (if it is connected), and a feed of personalized cards. Apple’s <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208108">FaceID uses many levels of presentation attack detection</a> (also known as “anti-spoofing”): it verifies your eyes are open and you are looking at the screen, and it uses a depth sensor to make sure it isn’t “seeing” a photo. The phone can then show hidden notification content or open the phone to the home screen. This measurement of trust and risk is benefited by understanding who could be in front of the device. We can’t forget that the machine learning that is doing biometrics is not a deterministic calculation; there is always some degree of uncertainty.</p>



<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color">Social and information norms define what we consider acceptable, who we trust, and how much. As trust goes up, we can take more risks in the way we handle information. However, it’s difficult to connect trust with risk without understanding people’s expectations. I have access to my <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/password-security-sharing">partner’s iPhone and know the passcode</a>. It would be a violation of a norm if I walked over and unlocked it without being asked, and doing so will lead to reduced trust between us. </p>



<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color">As we can see, biometrics does offer some benefits but won’t be the panacea for the unique uses of communal devices. Biometrics will allow those willing to opt-in to the collection of their biometric profile to gain personalized access with low friction, but it will never be useable for everyone with physical access. </p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<h2>Experiences</h2>



<p>People use a communal device for short experiences (checking the weather), ambient experiences (listening to music or glancing at a photo), and joint experiences (multiple people watching a movie). The device needs to be aware of norms within the space and between the multiple people in the space. Social norms are rules by which people decide how to act in a particular context or space. In the home, there are norms about what people should and should not do. If you are a guest, you try to see if people take their shoes off at the door; you don’t rearrange things on a bookshelf; and so on.</p>



<p>Most software is built to work for as many people as possible; this is called generalization. Norms stand in the way of generalization. Today’s technology isn’t good enough to adapt to every possible situation. One strategy is to simplify the software’s functionality and let the humans enforce norms. For example, when multiple people talk to an Echo at the same time, Alexa will either not understand or it will take action on the last command. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21452313/alexa-voice-assistant-ai-upgrade-amazon-echo-smart-speaker-multiple-people-tone-questions">Multi-turn conversations between multiple people</a> are still in their infancy. This is fine when there are understood norms–for example, between my partner and I. But it doesn’t work so well when you and a child are both trying to shout commands.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/DqO-tlVqweGB2Qn0dTCipZ9XZ-GlJKnel9bxMdOWKhqKjVYqftcKw6GNketKIQvVNjAAwsAVnH52CAd0K9KvF-idqGZtcbuTVKzPQM5uZiqcvPc9sQ0oBLzwsPm5NBdltxgvuJ0h" alt="" /><figcaption><br>Shared experiences can be challenging like a parent and child yelling at an Amazon Echo to play what they want.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Norms are interesting because they tend to be learned and negotiated over time, but are invisible. Experiences that are built for communal use need to be aware of these invisible norms through cues that can be detected from peoples’ actions and words. This gets especially tricky because a conversation between two people could include information subject to different expectations (in a Contextual Integrity sense) about how that information is used. With enough data, models can be created to “read between the lines” in both helpful and dangerous ways.</p>



<p>Video games already cater to multiple people’s experiences. With the Nintendo Switch or any other gaming system, several people can play together in a joint experience. However, the rules governing these experiences are never applied to, say, Netflix. The assumption is always that one person holds the remote. How might these experiences be improved if software could accept input from multiple sources (remote controls, voice, etc.) to build a selection of movies that is appropriate for everyone watching?</p>



<p>Communal experience problems highlight inequalities in households. With <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/05/17/upshot/women-workforce-employment-covid.html">women doing more household coordination</a> than ever, there is a need to rebalance the tasks for households. Most of the time these coordination tasks are relegated to personal devices, generally the wife’s mobile phone, when they involve the entire family (though there is a <a href="https://www.oecd.org/digital/bridging-the-digital-gender-divide.pdf">digital divide outside the US</a>). Without moving these experiences into a place that everyone can participate in, we will continue these inequalities.</p>



<p>So far, technology has been great at intermediating people for coordination through systems like text messaging, social networks, and collaborative documents. We don’t build interaction paradigms that allow for multiple people to engage at the same time in their communal spaces. To do this we need to address that the norms that dictate what is appropriate behavior are invisible and pervasive in the spaces these technologies are deployed.</p>



<h2>Ownership</h2>



<p>Many of these devices are not really owned by the people who buy them. As part of the current trend towards subscription-based business models, the device won’t function if you don’t subscribe to a service. Those services have license agreements that specify what you can and cannot do (which you can read if you have a <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/terms-of-service-visualizing-the-length-of-internet-agreements/">few hours to spare</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/12/opinion/facebook-google-privacy-policies.html">can understand them</a>).</p>



<p>For example, this has been an issue for fans of Amazon’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22381356/blink-homebridge-crackdown-amazon-subscriptions">Blink camera</a>. The home automation industry is fragmented: there are many vendors, each with its own application to control their particular devices. But most people don’t want to use different apps to control their lighting, their television, their security cameras, and their locks. Therefore, people have started to build controllers that span the different ecosystems. Doing so has caused Blink users to get their accounts suspended.</p>



<p>What’s even worse is that these license agreements can change whenever the company wants. Licenses are frequently modified with nothing more than a notification, after which something that was previously acceptable is now forbidden. In 2020, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/smart-home/wink-tells-users-pay-up-or-we-will-disable-smart-home-hub/">Wink suddenly applied</a> a monthly service charge; if you didn’t pay, the device would stop working. Also in 2020, Sonos caused a stir by saying they were going to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/5/21166777/sonos-ending-recycle-mode-trade-up-program-sustainability">“recycle” (disable) old devices.</a> They eventually changed their policy.</p>



<p>The issue isn’t just what you can do with your devices; it’s also what happens to the data they create. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/08/28/doorbell-camera-firm-ring-has-partnered-with-police-forces-extending-surveillance-reach/">Amazon’s Ring partnership</a> with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/18/amazon-ring-largest-civilian-surveillance-network-us">one in ten US police departments</a> troubles many privacy groups because it creates a vast surveillance program. What if you don’t want to be a part of the police state? Make sure you check the right box and read your terms of service. If you’re designing a device, you need to require users to opt in to data sharing (especially as regions adapt GDPR and CCPA-like regulation).</p>



<p>While techniques like <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html">federated learning</a> are on the horizon, to avoid latency issues and mass data collection, it remains to be seen whether those techniques are satisfactory for companies that collect data. Is there a benefit to both organizations and their customers to limit or obfuscate the transmission of data away from the device?</p>



<p>Ownership is particularly tricky for communal devices. This is a collision between the expectations of consumers who put something in their home; those expectations run directly against the way rent-to-use services are pitched. Until we acknowledge that hardware put in a home is different from a cloud service, we will never get it right.</p>



<h2>Lots of problems, now what?</h2>



<p>Now that we have dived into the various problems that rear their head with communal devices, what do we do about it? In the next article we discuss a way to consider the map of the communal space. This helps build a better understanding of how the communal device fits in the context of the space and services that exist already.</p>



<p>We will also provide a list of dos and don’ts for leaders, developers, and designers to consider when building a communal device.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In <a href="https://blog.metaobject.com/2021/06/glue-dark-matter-of-software.html">Glue: the Dark Matter of Software</a>, Marcel Weiher asks why there&#8217;s so much code. Why is Microsoft Office 400 million lines of code? Why are we always running into the truth of Alan Kay&#8217;s statement that &#8220;Software seems &#8216;large&#8217; and &#8216;complicated&#8217; for what it does&#8221;?</p>



<p>Weiher makes an interesting claim: the reason we have so much code is Glue Code, the code that connects everything together. It&#8217;s &#8220;invisible and massive&#8221;; it&#8217;s &#8220;deemed not important&#8221;; and, perhaps most important, it&#8217;s &#8220;quadratic&#8221;: the glue code is proportional to the square of the number of things you need to glue. That feels right; and in the past few years, we&#8217;ve become increasingly aware of the skyrocketing number of dependencies in any software project significantly more complex than &#8220;Hello, World!&#8221; We can all add our own examples: the classic article <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2015/file/86df7dcfd896fcaf2674f757a2463eba-Paper.pdf">Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems</a> shows a block diagram of a system in which machine learning is a tiny block in the middle, surrounded by all sorts of infrastructure: data pipelines, resource management, configuration, etc. Object Relational Management (ORM) frameworks are a kind of glue between application software and databases. Web frameworks facilitate gluing together components of various types, along with gluing that front end to some kind of back end. The list goes on.</p>



<p>Weiher makes another important point: the simplest abstraction for glue is the Unix pipe (|), although he points out that pipes are not the only solution. Anyone who has used Unix or a variant (and certainly anyone who has read–or in my case, written–chunks of <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/unix-power-tools/0596003307/">Unix Power Tools</a>) realizes how powerful the pipe is. A standard way to connect tools that are designed to do one thing well: that&#8217;s important.</p>



<p>But there&#8217;s another side to this problem, and one that we often sweep under the rug. A pipe has two ends: something that&#8217;s sending data, and something that&#8217;s receiving it. The sender needs to send data in a format that the receiver understands, or (more likely) the receiver needs to be able to parse and interpret the sender&#8217;s data in a way that it understands. You can pipe all the log data you want into an awk script (or perl, or python), but that script is still going to have to parse that data to make it interpretable. That&#8217;s really what those millions of lines of glue code do: either format data so the receiver can understand it or parse incoming data into a usable form. (This task falls more often on the receiver than the sender, largely because the sender often doesn&#8217;t—and shouldn&#8217;t—know anything about the receiver.)</p>



<p>From this standpoint, the real problem with glue isn&#8217;t moving data, though the Unix pipe is a great abstraction; it&#8217;s data integration. In a discussion about blockchains and medical records, Jim Stogdill once said &#8220;the real problem has nothing to do with blockchains. The real problem is data integration.&#8221; You can put all the data you want on a blockchain, or in a data warehouse, or in a subsurface data ocean the size of one of Jupiter&#8217;s moons, and you won&#8217;t solve the problem that application A generates data in a form that application B can&#8217;t use. If you know anything about medical records (and I know very little), you know that&#8217;s the heart of the problem. One major vendor has products that aren&#8217;t even compatible with each other, let alone competitors&#8217; systems. Not only are data formats incompatible, the meanings of fields in the data are often different in subtle ways. Chasing down those differences can easily run to hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of lines of code.</p>



<p>Pipes are great for moving data from one place to another. But there&#8217;s no equivalent standard for data integration. XML might play a role, but it only solves the easy part of the problem: standardizing parsing has some value, but the ease of parsing XML was always oversold, and the real problems stem more from schemas than data formats. (And please don&#8217;t play the &#8220;XML is human-readable and -writable&#8221; game.) JSON strikes me as XML for &#8220;pickling&#8221; JavaScript objects, replacing angle brackets with curly braces: a good idea that has gotten a lot of cross-language support, but like XML neglects the tough part of the problem.</p>



<p>Is data integration a problem that can be solved? In networking, we have standards for what data means and how to send it. All those TCP/IP packet headers that have been in use for almost 40 years (the first deployment of IPv4 was in 1982) have kept data flowing between systems built by different vendors. The fields in the header have been defined precisely, and new protocols have been built successfully at every layer of the network stack.</p>



<p>But this kind of standardization doesn&#8217;t solve the N squared problem. In a network stack, TCP talks to TCP; HTTPS talks to HTTPS. (Arguably, it keeps the N squared problem from being an N cubed problem.) The network stack designs the N squared problem out of existence, at least as far as the network itself is concerned, but that doesn’t help at the application layer. When we&#8217;re talking applications, a medical app needs to understand medical records, financial records, regulatory constraints, insurance records, reporting systems, and probably dozens more. Nor does standardization really solve the problem of new services. IPv4 desperately needs to be replaced (and IPv6 has been around since 1995), but IPv6 has been &#8220;5 years in the future&#8221; for two decades now. Hack on top of hack has kept IPv4 workable; but will layer and layer of hack work if we&#8217;re extending medical or financial applications?</p>



<p>Glue code expands as the square of the number of things that are glued. The need to glue different systems together is at the core of the problems facing software development; as systems become more all-encompassing, the need to integrate with different systems increases. The glue–which includes code written for data integration–becomes its own kind of technical debt, adding to the maintenance burden. It’s rarely (if ever) refactored or just plain removed because you always need to “maintain compatibility” with some old system.&nbsp; (Remember IE6?)</p>



<p>Is there a solution? In the future, we’ll probably need to integrate more services.&nbsp; The glue code will be more complex, since it will probably need to live in some “<a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/zero-trust-networks/9781491962183/">zero trust</a>” framework (another issue, but an important one).&nbsp; Still, knowing that you’re writing glue code, keeping track of where it is, and being proactive about removing it when it’s needed will keep the problem manageable. Designing interfaces carefully and observing standards will minimize the need for glue. In the final analysis, is glue code really a problem? Programming is ultimately about gluing things together, whether they’re microservices or programming libraries. Glue isn’t some kind of computational waste; it’s what holds our systems together.&nbsp; Glue development is software development.</p>

<p>We are traveling through the era of<a href="https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35"> Software 2.0</a>, in which the key components of modern software are increasingly determined by the parameters of machine learning models, rather than hard-coded in the language of for loops and if-else statements. There are serious challenges with such software and models, including the data they&#8217;re trained on, how they&#8217;re developed, how they&#8217;re deployed, and their impact on stakeholders. These challenges commonly result in both algorithmic bias and lack of model interpretability and explainability.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s another critical issue, which is in some ways upstream to the challenges of bias and explainability: while we seem to be living in the future with the creation of machine learning and deep learning models, we are still living in the Dark Ages with respect to the curation and labeling of our training data: <em>the vast majority of labeling is still done by hand</em>.</p>



<p>There are significant issues with hand labeling data:</p>



<ul><li>It introduces bias, and hand labels are neither interpretable nor explainable.</li><li>There are prohibitive costs to hand labeling datasets (both financial costs and the time of subject matter experts).</li><li>There is no such thing as gold labels: even the most well-known hand labeled datasets have label error rates of at least 5% (<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/04/01/1021619/ai-data-errors-warp-machine-learning-progress/">ImageNet has a label error rate of 5.8%</a>!).</li></ul>



<p>We are living through an era in which we get to decide how human and machine intelligence interact to build intelligent software to tackle many of the world&#8217;s toughest challenges. Labeling data is a fundamental part of human-mediated machine intelligence, and hand labeling is not only the most naive approach but also one of the most expensive (in many senses) and most dangerous ways of bringing humans in the loop. Moreover, it&#8217;s just not necessary as many alternatives are seeing increasing adoption. These include:</p>



<ul><li>Semi-supervised learning</li><li>Weak supervision</li><li>Transfer learning</li><li>Active learning</li><li>Synthetic data generation</li></ul>



<p>These techniques are part of a broader movement known as<a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai/machine-teaching/"> Machine Teaching</a>, a core tenet of which is getting both humans and machines each doing what they do best. We need to use expertise efficiently: the financial cost and time taken for experts to hand-label every data point can break projects, such as diagnostic imaging involving life-threatening conditions and security and defense-related satellite imagery analysis. Hand labeling in the age of these other technologies is akin to scribes hand-copying books post-Gutenberg.</p>



<p>There is also a burgeoning landscape of companies building products around these technologies, such as<a href="https://www.watchful.io/"> Watchful</a> (weak supervision and active learning; disclaimer: one of the authors is CEO of Watchful),<a href="https://snorkel.ai/"> Snorkel</a> (weak supervision),<a href="https://prodi.gy/"> Prodigy</a> (active learning),<a href="https://paralleldomain.com/"> Parallel Domain</a> (synthetic data), and<a href="https://aireverie.com/"> AI Reverie</a> (synthetic data).</p>



<h2><strong>Hand Labels and Algorithmic Bias</strong></h2>



<p>As<a href="https://twitter.com/rajiinio/status/1375957288276611075"> Deb Raji</a>, a Fellow at the Mozilla Foundation, has pointed out, algorithmic bias &#8220;can start anywhere in the system—pre-processing, post-processing, with task design, with modeling choices, etc.,&#8221; and the labeling of data is a crucial point at which bias can creep in.</p>

<p>High-profile cases of bias in training data resulting in harmful models include an<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight-idUSKCN1MK08G"> Amazon recruiting tool</a> that “penalized resumes that included the word &#8216;women’s,&#8217; as in &#8216;women’s chess club captain.&#8217;” Don&#8217;t take our word for it. Play the educational game<a href="https://www.survivalofthebestfit.com/"> Survival of the Best Fit</a> where you&#8217;re a CEO who uses a machine learning model to scale their hiring decisions and see how the model replicates the bias inherent in the training data. This point is key: as humans, we possess all types of biases, some harmful, others not so. When we feed hand labeled data to a machine learning model, it will detect those patterns and replicate them at scale. This is why<a href="https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/rim3pvdw/release/6"> David Donoho astutely observed</a> that perhaps we should call ML models <em>recycled intelligence</em> rather than <em>artificial intelligence</em>. Of course, given the amount of bias in hand labeled data, it may be more apt to refer to it as <em>recycled stupidity</em> (hat tip to<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_stupidity"> <em>artificial stupidity</em></a>).</p>



<p>The only way to interrogate the reasons for underlying bias arising from hand labels is to ask the labelers themselves their rationales for the labels in question, which is impractical, if not impossible, in the majority of cases: there are rarely records of who did the labeling, it is often outsourced via at-scale global APIs, such as Amazon&#8217;s Mechanical Turk and, when labels are created in-house, previous labelers are often no longer part of the organization.</p>



<h2><strong>Uninterpretable, Unexplainable</strong></h2>



<p>This leads to another key point: the lack of both interpretability and explainability in models built on hand labeled data. These are related concepts, and broadly speaking, interpretability is about correlation, whereas explainability is about causation. The former involves thinking about which features are correlated with the output variable, while the latter is concerned with why certain features lead to particular labels and predictions. We want models that give us results we can explain and some notion of how or why they work. For example, in the<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing"> ProPublica exposé of COMPAS recidivism risk model</a>, which made more false predictions that Black people would re-offend than it did for white people, it is essential to understand why the model is making the predictions it does. Lack of explainability and transparency were key ingredients of all the deployed-at-scale algorithms identified by Cathy O&#8217;Neil in<a href="https://weaponsofmathdestructionbook.com/"> <em>Weapons of Math Destruction</em></a>.</p>



<p>It may be counterintuitive that getting machines more in-the-loop for labeling can result in more explainable models but consider several examples:</p>



<ul><li>There is a growing area of<a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/blog/weak-supervision/"> <em>weak supervision</em></a><em>,</em> in which SMEs specify heuristics that the system then uses to make inferences about unlabeled data, the system calculates some potential labels, and then the SME evaluates the labels to determine where more heuristics might need to be added or tweaked. For example, when building a model of whether surgery was necessary based on medical transcripts, the SME may provide the following heuristic: if the transcription contains the term &#8220;anaesthesia&#8221; (or a regular expression similar to it), then surgery likely occurred (check out Russell Jurney&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/02/hand-labeling-past-future-nolabel-ai.html">Hand labeling is the past</a>&#8221; article for more on this).</li><li>In diagnostic imaging, we need to start cracking open the <em>neural nets</em> (such as CNNs and transformers)! SMEs could once again use heuristics to specify that tumors smaller than a certain size and/or of a particular shape are benign or malignant and, through such heuristics, we could drill down into different layers of the neural network to see what representations are learned where.</li><li>When your knowledge (via labels) is encoded in heuristics and functions, as above, this also has profound implications for models in production. When data drift inevitably occurs, you can return to the heuristics encoded in functions and edit them, instead of continually incurring the costs of hand labeling.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>On Auditing</strong></h2>



<p>Amidst the increasing concern about model transparency, we are seeing<a href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-algorithmic-auditing-trap-9a6f2d4d461d"> calls for algorithmic auditing</a>. Audits will play a key role in determining how algorithms are regulated and which ones are safe for deployment. One of the barriers to auditing is that high-performing models, such as deep learning models, are notoriously difficult to explain and reason about. There are several ways to probe this at the model level (such as SHAP and LIME), but that only tells part of the story. As we have seen, a major cause of algorithmic bias is that the data used to train it is biased or insufficient in some way.</p>



<p>There currently aren&#8217;t many ways to probe for bias or insufficiency at the data level. For example, the only way to explain hand labels in training data is to talk to the people who labeled it.<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P01-1005.pdf"> Active learning, on the other hand, allows for the principled creation of smaller datasets which have been intelligently sampled to maximize utility for a model</a>, which in turn reduces the overall auditable surface area. An example of active learning would be the following: instead of hand labeling every data point, the SME can label a representative subset of the data, which the system uses to make inferences about the unlabeled data. Then the system will ask the SME to label some of the unlabeled data, cross-check its own inferences and refine them based on the SME&#8217;s labels. This is an iterative process that terminates once the system reaches a target accuracy. Less data means less headache with respect to auditability.</p>



<p>Weak supervision more directly encodes expertise (and hence bias) as heuristics and functions, making it easier to evaluate where labeling went awry. For more opaque methods, such as synthetic data generation, it might be a bit difficult to interpret <em>why</em> a particular label was applied, which may actually complicate an audit. The methods we choose at this stage of the pipeline are important if we want to make sure the system as a whole is explainable.</p>



<h2><strong>The Prohibitive Costs of Hand Labeling</strong></h2>



<p>There are significant and differing forms of costs associated with hand labeling. Giant industries have been erected to deal with the demand for data-labeling services. Look no further than Amazon Mechanical Turk and all other cloud providers today. It is telling that data labeling is becoming increasingly outsourced globally, as detailed by Mary Gray in<a href="https://ghostwork.info/"> <em>Ghost Work</em></a><em>,</em> and there are increasingly serious concerns about the labor conditions under which<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/88apnv/underpaid-workers-are-being-forced-to-train-biased-ai-on-mechanical-turk"> hand labelers work around the globe</a>.</p>



<p>The sheer amount of capital involved was evidenced by<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/05/scale-ai-and-its-22-year-old-ceo-lock-down-100-million-to-help-label-silicon-valleys-data/"> Scale AI raising $100 million</a> in 2019 to bring their valuation to over $1 billion at a time when their business model solely revolved around using contractors to hand label data (it is telling that they&#8217;re now doing more than solely hand labels).</p>



<p>Money isn&#8217;t the only cost, and quite often, isn&#8217;t where the bottleneck or rate-limiting step occurs. Rather, it is the bandwidth and time of experts that is the scarcest resource. As a scarce resource, this is often expensive but, much of the time it isn&#8217;t even available (on top of this, the time it also takes to correct errors in labeling by data scientists is very expensive). Take financial services, for example, and the question of whether or not you should invest in a company based on information about the company scraped from various sources. In such a firm, there will only be a small handful of people who can make such a call, so labeling each data point would be incredibly expensive, and that&#8217;s if the SME even has the time.</p>



<p>This is not vertical-specific. The same challenge occurs in labeling legal texts for classification: is this clause talking about indemnification or not? And in medical diagnosis: is this tumor benign or malignant? As dependence on expertise increases, so does the likelihood that limited access to SMEs becomes a bottleneck.</p>



<p>The third cost is a cost to accuracy, reality, and ground truth: the fact that hand labels are often so wrong. The authors of<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14749.pdf"> a recent study from MIT</a> identified &#8220;label errors in the test sets of 10 of the most commonly-used computer vision, natural language, and audio datasets.&#8221; They estimated an average error rate of 3.4% across the datasets and show that ML model performance increases significantly once labels are corrected, in some instances. Also, consider that in many cases ground truth isn&#8217;t easy to find, if it exists at all. Weak supervision makes room for these cases (which are the majority) by assigning probabilistic labels without relying on ground truth annotations. It&#8217;s time to think statistically and probabilistically about our labels. There is good work happening here, such as Aka et al.&#8217;s (Google) recent paper<a href="https://deepai.org/publication/measuring-model-biases-in-the-absence-of-ground-truth"> Measuring Model Biases in the Absence of Ground Truth</a>.</p>



<p>The costs identified above are not one-off. When you train a model, you have to assume you&#8217;re going to train it again if it lives in production. Depending on the use case, that could be frequent. If you&#8217;re labeling by hand, it&#8217;s not just a large upfront cost to build a model. It is a set of ongoing costs each and every time.</p>

<h2><strong>The Efficacy of Automation Techniques</strong></h2>



<p>In terms of performance, even if getting machines to label much of your data results in slightly noisier labels, your models are often better off with 10 times as many slightly noisier labels. To dive a bit deeper into this, there are gains to be made by increasing training set size even if it means reducing overall label accuracy, but if you&#8217;re training classical ML models, only up to a point (past this point the model starts to see a dip in predictive accuracy). <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P01-1005.pdf">&#8220;Scaling to Very Very Large Corpora for Natural Language Disambiguation (Banko &amp; Brill, 2001)&#8221;</a> demonstrates this in a traditional ML setting by exploring the relationship between hand labeled data, automatically labeled data, and subsequent model performance. A more recent paper,<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.00409.pdf"> &#8220;Deep Learning Scaling Is Predictable, Empirically (2017)&#8221;</a>, explores the quantity/quality relationship relative to modern state of the art model architectures, illustrating the fact that SOTA architectures are data hungry, and accuracy improves as a power law as training sets grow:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We empirically validate that DL model accuracy improves as a power-law as we grow training sets for state-of-the-art (SOTA) model architectures in four machine learning domains: machine translation, language modeling, image processing, and speech recognition. These power-law learning curves exist across all tested domains, model architectures, optimizers, and loss functions.</p></blockquote>



<p>The key question isn&#8217;t &#8220;should I hand label my training data or should I label it programmatically?&#8221; It should instead be &#8220;which parts of my data should I hand label and which parts should I label programmatically?&#8221; According to these papers, by introducing expensive hand labels sparingly into largely programmatically generated datasets, you can maximize the effort/model accuracy tradeoff on SOTA architectures that wouldn&#8217;t be possible if you had hand labeled alone.</p>



<p>The stacked costs of hand labeling wouldn&#8217;t be so challenging were they necessary, but the fact of the matter is that there are so many other interesting ways to get human knowledge into models. There&#8217;s still an open question around where and how we want humans in the loop and what&#8217;s the right design for these systems. Areas such as weak supervision, self-supervised learning, synthetic data generation, and active learning, for example, along with the products that implement them, provide promising avenues for avoiding the pitfalls of hand labeling. Humans belong in the loop at the labeling stage, but so do machines. In short, it&#8217;s time to move beyond hand labels.</p>

<p>Home assistants and smart displays are being sold in record numbers, but they are built wrong. They are designed with one person in mind: the owner. These technologies need to fit into the communal spaces where they are placed, like homes and offices. If they don’t fit, they will be unplugged and put away due to lack of trust.</p>



<p>The problems are subtle at first. Your Spotify playlist starts to have recommendations for songs you don’t like. You might see a photo you took on someone else’s digital frame. An Apple TV reminds you of a new episode of a show your partner watches. Guests are asking you to turn on your IoT-enabled lights for them. The wrong person’s name shows up in the Zoom call. Reminders for medication aren’t heard by the person taking the medication. Bank account balances are announced during a gathering of friends.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Amazon_device_words-1048x589.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13813" srcset="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Amazon_device_words-1048x589.jpg 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Amazon_device_words-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Amazon_device_words-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Amazon_device_words-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Amazon_device_words-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px" /><figcaption>Would you want your bank account balances announced during a dinner party?</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is the start of a series discussing the design of communal devices–devices designed to work in communal spaces. The series is a call to action for everyone developing communal devices–whether you are creating business cases, designing experiences, or building technology–to take a step back and consider what is really needed.</p>



<p>This first article discusses what communal devices are, and how problems that appear result from our assumptions about how they’re used. Those assumptions were inherited from the world of PCs: the rules that apply to your laptop or your iPad just don’t apply to home assistants and other “smart devices,” from light bulbs to refrigerators.&nbsp; It isn’t just adding the ability for people to switch accounts. We need a new paradigm for the future of technical infrastructure for our homes and offices. In this series of articles we will tell you how we got here, why it is problematic, and where to go to enable communal computing.</p>



<h2>The Wrong Model</h2>



<p>Problems with communal devices arise because the industry has focused on a specific model for how these devices are used: a single person buys, sets up, and uses the device. If you bought one of these devices (for example, a smart speaker) recently, how many other people in your household did you involve in setting it up?</p>



<p>Smart screen makers like Amazon and Google continue to make small changes to try to fix the weirdness. They have recently added technology to automatically personalize based on someone’s face or voice. These are temporary fixes that will only be effective until the next special case reveals itself. Until the industry realizes the communal nature of users’ needs they will just be short lived patches. We need to turn the model around to make the devices communal first, rather than communal as an afterthought.</p>



<p>I recently left Facebook Reality Labs, where I was working on the Facebook Portal identity platform, and realized that there was zero discourse about this problem in the wider world of technology. I’ve read through many articles on how to create Alexa skills and attended talks about the use of IoT, and I’ve even made my own voice skills. There was no discussion of the communal impacts of those technologies. If we don’t address the problems this creates, these devices will be relegated to a small number of uses, or unplugged to make room for the next one. The problems were there, just beneath the shiny veneer of new technologies.</p>



<h3>Communal began at home</h3>



<p>Our home infrastructure was originally communal. Consider a bookcase: someone may have bought it, but anyone in the household could update it with new books or tchotchkes. Guests could walk up to browse the books you had there. It was meant to be shared with the house and those that had access to it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/iStock-882859590-1048x699.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13814" srcset="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/iStock-882859590-1048x699.jpg 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/iStock-882859590-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/iStock-882859590-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/iStock-882859590-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/iStock-882859590-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px" /><figcaption>The old landline in your kitchen is the original communal device.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Same for the old landline that was in the kitchen. When you called, you were calling a household. You didn’t know specifically who would pick up. Anyone who was part of that household could answer. We had protocols for getting the phone from the person who answered the call to the intended recipient. Whoever answered could either yell for someone to pick up the phone elsewhere in the home, or take a message. If the person answering the phone wasn’t a member of the household, it would be odd, and you’d immediately think “wrong number.”</p>



<p>It wasn’t until we had the user model for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-sharing">mainframe time sharing</a> that we started to consider who was using a computer. This evolved into full login systems with passwords, password reset, two factor authentication, biometric authentication, and more. As computers became more common,&nbsp; what made sense inside of research and academic institutions was repurposed for the office.</p>



<p>In the 1980s and 1990s a lot of homes got their first personal computer. These were shared, communal devices, though more by neglect than by intention. A parent would purchase it and then set it up in the living room so everyone could use it. The account switching model wasn’t added until visual systems like Windows arrived, but account management was poorly designed and rarely used. Everyone just piggybacked on each other’s access. If anyone wanted privacy, they had to lock folders with a password or hide them in an endless hierarchy.</p>



<h2>Early Attempts at Communal Computing</h2>



<p>Xerox-PARC started to think about what more communal or ubiquitous computing would mean. However, they focused on fast account switching. They were answering the question: how could I get the personal context to this communal device as fast as possible? One project was digitizing the whiteboard, a fundamentally communal device. It was called <a href="https://www.markstefik.com/?page_id=155">The Colab</a> and offered a way for anyone to capture content in a meeting room and then walk it around the office to other shared boards.</p>



<p>Not only did the researchers at PARC think about sharing computers for presentations, they also wondered how they could have someone walk up to a computer and have it be configured for them automatically. It was enabled by special cards called “Active Badges,” described in “<a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.49.1301&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">A New Location Technique for the Active Office</a>.” The paper starts with an important realization:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“&#8230;researchers have begun to examine computers that would autonomously change their functionality based on observations of who or what was around them. By determining their context, using input from sensor systems distributed throughout the environment, computing devices could personalize themselves to their current user, adapt their behaviour according to their location, or react to their surroundings.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Understanding the context around the device is very important in building a system that adapts. At this point, however, researchers were still thinking about a ‘current user’ and their position relative to the system, rather than the many people who could be nearby.</p>



<p>Even Bill Gates had communal technology in his futuristic home back then. He would give every guest a pin to put on their person that would allow them to <a href="https://money.usnews.com/money/business-economy/articles/1997/11/23/xanadu-20">personalize the lighting, temperature, and music</a> as they went from room to room. Most of these technologies didn’t go anywhere, but they were an attempt at making the infrastructure around us adapt to the people who were in the space.&nbsp; The term “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitous_computing">ubiquitous computing</a>” (also known as “pervasive computing”) was coined to discuss the installation of sensors around a space; the ideas behind ubiquitous computing later led to the Internet of Things (IoT). </p>



<h2>Communal Computing Comes Home</h2>



<p>When the late 2000s rolled around, we found that everyone wanted their own personal computing device, most likely an iPhone. Shared home PCs started to die. The prevalence of smartphones and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204085615/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hkYOf_SCQ1ugSXKLXCsSs7qWnsQA">personal laptops killed</a> the need for shared home PCs. The drive goal to provide information and communication services conveniently wherever the users happened to be, including if they’re sitting together on their couches.</p>



<p>When the Amazon Echo with Alexa was released, they were sold to individuals with Amazon accounts, but they were clearly communal devices. Anyone could ask their Echo a question, and it would answer. That’s where the problem starts.&nbsp; Although Echo is a communal device, its user model wasn’t significantly different than the early PCs: one account, one user, shared by everyone in the household. As a result, items being mistakenly ordered by children made Amazon pull back some features that were focused on shopping. Echo’s usage ended up being driven by music and weather.</p>



<p>With the wild success of the Echo and the proliferation of Alexa-enabled devices, there appeared a new device market for home assistants, some just for audio and others with screens. Products from Apple (HomePod with Siri), Google (Home Hub), and Facebook (Portal) followed. This includes less interactive devices like digital picture frames from <a href="https://www.nixplay.com/">Nixplay</a>, <a href="https://www.skylightframe.com/">Skylight</a>, and others.</p>



<h2>Ambient Computing</h2>



<p>“<a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/google-and-ambient-computing/">Ambient computing</a>” is a term that has been coined to talk about digital devices blending into the infrastructure of the environment. A <a href="https://mapprojectoffice.com/e-paper">recent paper by Map Project Office</a> focused on how “ambient tech brings the outside world into your home in new ways, where information isn&#8217;t being channelled solely through your smartphone but rather a series of devices.” We take a step back from screens and wonder how the system itself is the environment.</p>



<p>The concept of ambient computing is related to the focus of marketing organizations on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnichannel">omnichannel experiences</a>. Omnichannel is the fact that people don’t want to start and end experiences on the same device. I might start looking for travel on a smartphone but will not feel comfortable booking a trip until I’m on a laptop. There is different information and experience needed for these devices. When I worked at KAYAK, some people were afraid of buying $1,000 plane tickets on a mobile device, even though they found it there. The small screen made them feel uncomfortable because they didn’t have enough information to make a decision. We found that they wanted to finalize the plans on the desktop.</p>



<p>Ambient computing takes this concept and combines voice-controlled interfaces with sensor interfaces–for example, in devices like automatic shades that close or open based on the temperature. These devices are finding traction, but we can’t forget all of the other communal experiences that already exist in the world:</p>

<p>All of these have built experience models that need a specific, personal context and rarely consider everyone who could have access to them. To rethink the way that we build these communal devices, it is important that we understand this history and refocus the design on key problems that are not yet solved for communal devices.</p>



<h3>Problems with single user devices in the home</h3>



<p>After buying a communal device, people notice weirdness or annoyances. They are symptoms of something much larger: core problems and key questions that should have considered the role of communities rather than individuals. Here are some of those questions:</p>



<ol><li>Identity: do we know all of the people who are using the device?</li><li>Privacy: are we exposing (or hiding) the right content for all of the people with access?</li><li>Security: are we allowing all of the people using the device to do or see what they should and are we protecting the content from people that shouldn’t?</li><li>Experience: what is the contextually appropriate display or next action?</li><li>Ownership: who owns all of the data and services attached to the device that multiple people are using?</li></ol>



<p>If we don’t address these communal items, users will lose trust in their devices. They will be used for a few key things like checking the weather, but go unused for a majority of the day. They are eventually removed when another, newer device needs the plug. Then the cycle starts again. The problems keep happening and the devices keep getting recycled.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/communal-computings-many-problems/">following article</a>s we will dive into how these problems manifest themselves across these domains and reframe the system with dos and don’ts for building communal devices.</p>
